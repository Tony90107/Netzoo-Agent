What I understood you are asking for:
1. "one regulatory network per stage" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA or LIONESS-DRAGON.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The user has expression data from four developmental stages and is interested in comparing the regulatory networks across these stages.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage.

Captured request parameters:

- `expression_file`: baseline

**DRAGON**: Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON.

Routing-level input modality: multi omic continuous.

Method premise: infer conditional associations using partial correlation.

DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Other declared controls (not matched to this request; defaults apply unless you set them): `output_format`=matrix, `lambda1`, `lambda2`.

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each TF's activity in every sample" -- available from GIRAFFE.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "We want each TF's activity in every sample" — The activity matrix holds one value per TF per sample (TF by sample, written as the `.tfa` output). GIRAFFE reports absolute activity, so every value is zero or positive.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

For your question ("which TFs change over the course of treatment"):
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix gives each TF's activity in each sample; test each TF's activity between the conditions (paired when the same individuals give both), with multiple-testing correction.

This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

What you asked about:

- "compares survival between the subtypes" — Subtype labels can be compared with clinical variables -- survival between subtypes, for example; that needs a clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs. The pathway mutation scores show which pathways separate the subtypes.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The user has the necessary expression data from 140 samples.
- Batch effects need to be corrected before co-expression analysis.

Selected path: **COBRA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "a batch-corrected count matrix for later differential expression" — Each covariate's component is a gene-by-gene co-expression attributable to that covariate; the adjusted co-expression can be passed to PANDA, PUMA or OTTER as coexpression_file after its identifiers and order are revalidated. Interpret each component relative to how the design matrix codes that covariate (for example, which level is the reference).

**COBRA** — Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `design_file`: sample covariate design matrix

Outputs:

- `coexpression_network`: Inferred gene-to-gene associations.

About "the causal direction of each link": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 25 tumors, 26 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each TF's activity in every sample" -- available from GIRAFFE.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "We want each TF's activity in every sample" — The activity matrix holds one value per TF per sample (TF by sample, written as the `.tfa` output). GIRAFFE reports absolute activity, so every value is zero or positive.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

For your question ("which TFs change over the course of treatment"):
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix gives each TF's activity in each sample; test each TF's activity between the conditions (paired when the same individuals give both), with multiple-testing correction.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- Batch effects are significant and need to be corrected for accurate co-expression analysis.

Selected path: **COBRA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "a batch-corrected count matrix for later differential expression" — Each covariate's component is a gene-by-gene co-expression attributable to that covariate; the adjusted co-expression can be passed to PANDA, PUMA or OTTER as coexpression_file after its identifiers and order are revalidated. Interpret each component relative to how the design matrix codes that covariate (for example, which level is the reference).

**COBRA** — Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

Required workflow inputs:

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The model will utilize expression data from multiple visits and consider the influence of motifs and PPI.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors.

Captured request parameters:

- `expression_file`: four

**GIRAFFE**: Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression.

Routing-level input modality: expression matrix.

Method premise: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors; jointly infer a TF-gene regulatory matrix and a TF-by-sample activity matrix; interpret TF-gene regulatory weights as coefficients in a linear expression model; estimate positive activating and negative inhibitory partial regulatory effects; model gene expression with transcription factor activities as predictors.

GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

**PUMA** fits the result you describe if you have a motif prior and a PPI network.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PUMA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network
   - `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PUMA** separately; **LIONESS-PUMA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PUMA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PUMA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PUMA runs and give N network files (for your 90 patients, 91 PUMA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

For your question ("a test of which edges differ with the time point"):
- **PUMA** — Build one network for each time point on the same genes and priors, then compare edge weights or targeting scores between them. This compares the time points across all individuals but does not use the pairing: each individual's samples from the different time points are pooled into separate networks. To keep the pairing, use the per-sample (LIONESS) version and compare each individual's samples.
- **LIONESS-PUMA** — Each sample gets its own network, so each individual's networks from the different time points can be compared directly: test the within-individual differences of edge weights or targeting scores, for example with a paired test or a linear model with an individual term.
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Full reply:

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "one TF-gene network for 30,000 genes from 400 samples" -- available from PANDA, PUMA, OTTER or GIRAFFE.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Based on what you said — "our machine has little memory." — **OTTER** fits better: the network is large and memory or runtime is a concern.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **OTTER** fits that result and scale.

**OTTER** (recommend) — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. Produces inferred regulator-to-target associations (one cohort-level result).

Conditional assumptions to confirm:
- It also needs a TF-motif prior and protein-interaction prior, which the request does not mention.

Other compatible option(s):
- **PANDA** — preferred when: results must be comparable with the widely published approach, or serve as a base network for later per-sample analysis; approach: iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow.
- **GIRAFFE** — preferred when: a regulator's activity may differ from its own expression, or activating versus repressing effects are needed; each sample's regulator activity level is needed, apart from the regulator's own expression; approach: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors.

About your concern that memory is a limiting factor (for example, an earlier run ran out of memory):
- **OTTER** — `precision=single` keeps OTTER's largest array, the gene-by-gene co-expression matrix, in single precision during the optimization. The loader first computes that matrix in double precision, so peak memory while loading is not reduced, and the optimization and the output network stay in double precision.

Should I use OTTER, or does another listed option fit your study better?

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a regulatory network in which enhancers, not TFs, are the regulators of each gene" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

**PUMA** fits the result you describe if you have a motif prior and a PPI network.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Selected path: **COBRA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "a batch-corrected count matrix for later differential expression" — Each covariate's component is a gene-by-gene co-expression attributable to that covariate; the adjusted co-expression can be passed to PANDA, PUMA or OTTER as coexpression_file after its identifiers and order are revalidated. Interpret each component relative to how the design matrix codes that covariate (for example, which level is the reference).

**COBRA** — Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `design_file`: sample covariate design matrix

Outputs:

- `coexpression_network`: Inferred gene-to-gene associations.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

What you asked about:

- "compares survival between the subtypes" — Subtype labels can be compared with clinical variables -- survival between subtypes, for example; that needs a clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs. The pathway mutation scores show which pathways separate the subtypes.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "We want each TF's activity in every sample" — The activity matrix holds one value per TF per sample (TF by sample, written as the `.tfa` output). GIRAFFE reports absolute activity, so every value is zero or positive.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

For your question ("which TFs change over the course of treatment"):
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix gives each TF's activity in each sample; test each TF's activity between the conditions (paired when the same individuals give both), with multiple-testing correction.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

About "the causal direction of each link": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a network of direct links between the two layers" -- available from DRAGON.
2. "the causal direction of each link" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

About "the causal direction of each link": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "We want each TF's activity in every sample" — The activity matrix holds one value per TF per sample (TF by sample, written as the `.tfa` output). GIRAFFE reports absolute activity, so every value is zero or positive.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

For your question ("which TFs change over the course of treatment"):
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix gives each TF's activity in each sample; test each TF's activity between the conditions (paired when the same individuals give both), with multiple-testing correction.

What I understood you are asking for:

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The user has expression data from four developmental stages and is interested in comparing the regulatory networks across these stages.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PUMA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network
   - `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PUMA** separately; **LIONESS-PUMA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PUMA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PUMA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PUMA runs and give N network files (for your 25 tumors, 26 PUMA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

**What your data allows.** Your request names only a motif prior and a PPI network. LIONESS-PUMA and PUMA also need an expression matrix and a miRNA list. Do you also have a miRNA list?

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

You mentioned "15 donors". Whether that counts as a handful of samples or as dozens or more is your call for this study design; I do not map a sample count to these categories myself.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The user has expression data from four developmental stages and is interested in comparing the regulatory networks across these stages.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

About your concern that memory is a limiting factor (for example, an earlier run ran out of memory):
- **OTTER** — `precision=single` keeps OTTER's largest array, the gene-by-gene co-expression matrix, in single precision during the optimization. The loader first computes that matrix in double precision, so peak memory while loading is not reduced, and the optimization and the output network stay in double precision.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a network for each patient" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.
2. "a test of which edges differ with the time point" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: A statistical model outside NetZoo (e.g. limma, Cox), with multiple-testing correction; needs a clinical table keyed by sample ID.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 90 patients, 91 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

For your question ("a test of which edges differ with the time point"):
- **PANDA** — Build one network for each time point on the same genes and priors, then compare edge weights or targeting scores between them. This compares the time points across all individuals but does not use the pairing: each individual's samples from the different time points are pooled into separate networks. To keep the pairing, use the per-sample (LIONESS) version and compare each individual's samples.
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Each sample gets its own network, so each individual's networks from the different time points can be compared directly: test the within-individual differences of edge weights or targeting scores, for example with a paired test or a linear model with an individual term.
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The model will utilize expression data from multiple visits and consider the influence of motifs and PPI.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors.

Captured request parameters:

- `expression_file`: four

**GIRAFFE**: Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression.

Routing-level input modality: expression matrix.

Method premise: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors; jointly infer a TF-gene regulatory matrix and a TF-by-sample activity matrix; interpret TF-gene regulatory weights as coefficients in a linear expression model; estimate positive activating and negative inhibitory partial regulatory effects; model gene expression with transcription factor activities as predictors.

GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

About "the causal direction of each link": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Fallback recommendation: **DRAGON**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** is related to that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Based on what you said — "Is there a method that infers a network in which kinases regulate the activity of TFs through phosphorylation?" — **GIRAFFE** fits better: a regulator's activity may differ from its own expression, or activating versus repressing effects are needed.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** (recommend) — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network. Produces inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values (one cohort-level result).

Conditional assumptions to confirm:
- It also needs an expression matrix and TF-motif prior and protein-interaction prior, which the request does not mention.

Other compatible option(s):
- If you need a TF-only regulatory network instead: **PANDA**, **OTTER**.
- **PUMA** — preferred when: the regulators include miRNAs or similar short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade target transcripts after transcription; approach: model miRNA-to-gene regulation.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Should I use GIRAFFE, or does another listed option fit your study better?

**What your data allows.** PANDA, OTTER and GIRAFFE also need a motif prior and a PPI network; PUMA also needs a motif prior, a PPI network and a miRNA list. With the data you describe alone, LIONESS-COEXPRESSION builds one cohort-level gene-gene co-expression network (genes only, no regulator roles) instead. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PUMA also writes the cohort network, so PUMA need not run first.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:

   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a separate co-expression network for each sample" -- available from LIONESS-COEXPRESSION.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Fallback recommendation: **CONDOR**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a community assignment. **CONDOR** is related to that result.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

About "the causal direction of each link": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Full reply:

```
This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

About your concern that memory is a limiting factor (for example, an earlier run ran out of memory):
- **OTTER** — `precision=single` keeps OTTER's largest array, the gene-by-gene co-expression matrix, in single precision during the optimization. The loader first computes that matrix in double precision, so peak memory while loading is not reduced, and the optimization and the output network stay in double precision.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Based on what you said — "our machine has little memory." — **OTTER** fits better: the network is large and memory or runtime is a concern.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **OTTER** fits that result and scale.

**OTTER** (recommend) — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. Produces inferred regulator-to-target associations (one cohort-level result).

Conditional assumptions to confirm:
- It also needs a TF-motif prior and protein-interaction prior, which the request does not mention.

Other compatible option(s):
- **PANDA** — preferred when: results must be comparable with the widely published approach, or serve as a base network for later per-sample analysis; approach: iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow.
- **GIRAFFE** — preferred when: a regulator's activity may differ from its own expression, or activating versus repressing effects are needed; each sample's regulator activity level is needed, apart from the regulator's own expression; approach: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors.

About your concern that memory is a limiting factor (for example, an earlier run ran out of memory):
- **OTTER** — `precision=single` keeps OTTER's largest array, the gene-by-gene co-expression matrix, in single precision during the optimization. The loader first computes that matrix in double precision, so peak memory while loading is not reduced, and the optimization and the output network stay in double precision.

Should I use OTTER, or does another listed option fit your study better?

**PUMA** fits the result you describe if you have a motif prior and a PPI network.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "the co-expression with batch effects removed" -- available from COBRA.
2. "a batch-corrected count matrix for later differential expression" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The user has the necessary expression data from the 140 samples.
- Batch effects need to be corrected before inferring the co-expression network.

Selected path: **COBRA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "a batch-corrected count matrix for later differential expression" — Each covariate's component is a gene-by-gene co-expression attributable to that covariate; the adjusted co-expression can be passed to PANDA, PUMA or OTTER as coexpression_file after its identifiers and order are revalidated. Interpret each component relative to how the design matrix codes that covariate (for example, which level is the reference).

**COBRA** — Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `design_file`: sample covariate design matrix

Outputs:

- `coexpression_network`: Inferred gene-to-gene associations.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**LIONESS-DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PUMA also writes the cohort network, so PUMA need not run first.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage.

Captured request parameters:

**DRAGON**: Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON.

Routing-level input modality: multi omic continuous.

Method premise: infer conditional associations using partial correlation.

DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Other declared controls (not matched to this request; defaults apply unless you set them): `output_format`=matrix, `lambda1`, `lambda2`.

It sounds like you want community assignments.

The only registered workflow compatible with this request is **CONDOR**, but your request does not settle whether one cohort-wide result or one result per sample is wanted. Is CONDOR the analysis you want? If so, say so and name its inputs; otherwise describe the result you need.

Compatible workflow method and input/output details:
- **Community assignments — CONDOR**
  - Registered purpose: Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR.
  - Method premise: find communities in a two-mode network; return network modules or community membership
  - Mathematical interpretation: CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.
  - Required inputs: all of: bipartite network.
  - Declared output: community assignments (cohort-level aggregate).

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

About "predict their functions": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

What you asked about:

- "compares survival between the subtypes" — Subtype labels can be compared with clinical variables -- survival between subtypes, for example; that needs a clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs. The pathway mutation scores show which pathways separate the subtypes.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it.

Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

You mentioned "15 donors". Whether that counts as a handful of samples or as dozens or more is your call for this study design; I do not map a sample count to these categories myself.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**Multi omic network**
- **DRAGON** — DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-DRAGON**. Needs DRAGON omics layer 1 and DRAGON omics layer 2.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The user has access to spatial transcriptomics data and associated motifs and PPI information.

Which result do you mean: inferred regulator-to-target associations (PANDA or PUMA or LIONESS-PANDA or LIONESS-PUMA or OTTER or GIRAFFE); or inferred associations between omics features (DRAGON or LIONESS-DRAGON)?

**Data your question needs.** Your question needs a motif prior and a PPI network, which your request does not mention. Do you have a motif prior and a PPI network?

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "design a synthetic promoter sequence that drives strong expression only in hepatocytes" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "subtypes the patients from pathway-level mutation scores" -- available from SAMBAR.
2. "compares survival between the subtypes" -- available from SAMBAR's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: A test outside NetZoo with a clinical table keyed by sample ID.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

What you asked about:

- "compares survival between the subtypes" — Subtype labels can be compared with clinical variables -- survival between subtypes, for example; that needs a clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs. The pathway mutation scores show which pathways separate the subtypes.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:

   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a fuzzy community structure in which every gene has a degree of membership in each community." -- available from CONDOR.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **COBRA** — COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Needs expression matrix and sample covariate design matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do you need to separate or adjust co-expression for batch, site or other sample covariates? (co-expression must be separated or adjusted for batch, site or other covariates → COBRA; no sample covariates need to be separated or adjusted → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION)

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PUMA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network
   - `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PUMA** separately; **LIONESS-PUMA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PUMA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PUMA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PUMA runs and give N network files (for your 90 patients, 91 PUMA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

For your question ("a test of which edges differ with the time point"):
- **PUMA** — Build one network for each time point on the same genes and priors, then compare edge weights or targeting scores between them. This compares the time points across all individuals but does not use the pairing: each individual's samples from the different time points are pooled into separate networks. To keep the pairing, use the per-sample (LIONESS) version and compare each individual's samples.
- **LIONESS-PUMA** — Each sample gets its own network, so each individual's networks from the different time points can be compared directly: test the within-individual differences of edge weights or targeting scores, for example with a paired test or a linear model with an individual term.
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.

Full reply:

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The user has expression data from four developmental stages and is interested in comparing the resulting regulatory networks.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

Your request describes more than one scientific reading. Each is listed with the registered workflows that fit it, their algorithmic premises and inputs:

**Reading 1 -- "We want a network for each patient"**
Result: regulatory networks (sample-specific), from inputs the request does not state.
- **TF-only regulatory network — PANDA → LIONESS-PANDA**
  - Registered purpose: Infer aggregate PANDA and sample-specific LIONESS-PANDA networks.
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks; iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow
  - Mathematical interpretation: LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.
  - Mathematical interpretation: Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
  - Declared output: regulatory networks (cohort-level aggregate; sample-specific, one network per sample).

The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**LIONESS-DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q.

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PUMA also writes the cohort network, so PUMA need not run first.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **COBRA** — COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Needs expression matrix and sample covariate design matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Should the result be aggregate or sample-specific?

About "predict their functions": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

All of them derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks, and iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The expression data is suitable for constructing regulatory networks.
- The motifs and PPI data can be integrated into the network construction.

For your question ("a test of which edges differ with the time point"):
- **LIONESS-PANDA**, **LIONESS-PUMA** — Each sample gets its own network, so each individual's networks from the different time points can be compared directly: test the within-individual differences of edge weights or targeting scores, for example with a paired test or a linear model with an individual term.
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

About your concern that memory is a limiting factor (for example, an earlier run ran out of memory):
- **OTTER** — `precision=single` keeps OTTER's largest array, the gene-by-gene co-expression matrix, in single precision during the optimization. The loader first computes that matrix in double precision, so peak memory while loading is not reduced, and the optimization and the output network stay in double precision.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Full reply:

```
What I understood you are asking for:
1. "one regulatory network per stage" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA or LIONESS-DRAGON.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The user has expression data from four developmental stages and is interested in comparing the regulatory networks across these stages.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

**PUMA** fits the result you describe if you have a motif prior and a PPI network.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "the co-expression with batch effects removed" -- available from COBRA.
2. "a batch-corrected count matrix for later differential expression" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- Batch effects need to be removed for accurate co-expression analysis.

Selected path: **COBRA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "a batch-corrected count matrix for later differential expression" — Each covariate's component is a gene-by-gene co-expression attributable to that covariate; the adjusted co-expression can be passed to PANDA, PUMA or OTTER as coexpression_file after its identifiers and order are revalidated. Interpret each component relative to how the design matrix codes that covariate (for example, which level is the reference).

**COBRA** — Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

About "predict their functions": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each TF's activity per sample" -- available from GIRAFFE.
2. "each TF's protein amount quantified from our raw mass spectra" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "we want each TF's activity per sample" — The activity matrix holds one value per TF per sample (TF by sample, written as the `.tfa` output). GIRAFFE reports absolute activity, so every value is zero or positive.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage.

Captured request parameters:

- `expression_file`: baseline

**DRAGON**: Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON.

Routing-level input modality: multi omic continuous.

Method premise: infer conditional associations using partial correlation.

DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Other declared controls (not matched to this request; defaults apply unless you set them): `output_format`=matrix, `lambda1`, `lambda2`.

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

- **OTTER** — `precision=single` keeps OTTER's largest array, the gene-by-gene co-expression matrix, in single precision during the optimization.

You do not need to run **PUMA** separately; **LIONESS-PUMA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PUMA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PUMA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PUMA runs and give N network files (for your 25 tumors, 26 PUMA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

All of them derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks, and iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The model will utilize expression data collected at multiple time points.

Which regulator type should the network model: transcription factors, miRNA regulators, or both?

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a dynamic model of how each TF's activity evolves from one visit to the next" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The model will utilize expression data from multiple visits.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors.

Captured request parameters:

- `expression_file`: four

**GIRAFFE**: Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression.

Routing-level input modality: expression matrix.

Method premise: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors; jointly infer a TF-gene regulatory matrix and a TF-by-sample activity matrix; interpret TF-gene regulatory weights as coefficients in a linear expression model; estimate positive activating and negative inhibitory partial regulatory effects; model gene expression with transcription factor activities as predictors.

GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

**Data your question needs.** Your question needs a motif prior and a PPI network, which your request does not mention. Do you have a motif prior and a PPI network?

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Fallback recommendation: **CONDOR**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a community assignment. **CONDOR** is related to that result.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

**Data your question needs.** Your question needs a motif prior and a PPI network, which your request does not mention. Do you have a motif prior and a PPI network?

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

About "predict their functions": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PUMA also writes the cohort network, so PUMA need not run first.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

You do not need to run **PUMA** separately; **LIONESS-PUMA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PUMA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PUMA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PUMA runs and give N network files (for your 25 tumors, 26 PUMA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

Which scientific question should we start with, and which of these inputs do you have? We can also investigate the hypotheses in parallel.

About "the causal direction of each link": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage.

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a regulatory network in which enhancers, not TFs, are the regulators of each gene" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

What you asked about:

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "subtypes the patients from pathway-level mutation scores" -- available from SAMBAR.
2. "compares survival between the subtypes" -- available from SAMBAR's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: A test outside NetZoo with a clinical table keyed by sample ID.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

What you asked about:

- "compares survival between the subtypes" — Subtype labels can be compared with clinical variables -- survival between subtypes, for example; that needs a clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs. The pathway mutation scores show which pathways separate the subtypes.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "subtypes the patients from pathway-level mutation scores" -- available from SAMBAR.
2. "compares survival between the subtypes" -- available from SAMBAR's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: A test outside NetZoo with a clinical table keyed by sample ID.
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

What you asked about:

- "compares survival between the subtypes" — Subtype labels can be compared with clinical variables -- survival between subtypes, for example; that needs a clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs. The pathway mutation scores show which pathways separate the subtypes.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**LIONESS-DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PUMA also writes the cohort network, so PUMA need not run first.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PUMA**. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators.

Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.
