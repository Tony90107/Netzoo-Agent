What I understood you are asking for:
1. "an estimate of how active each transcription factor is in each patient" -- available from GIRAFFE.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Selected path: **PUMA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Yes, in principle, data can weaken an unreliable TF-binding prior and quantify uncertainty about it, but only if the model explicitly represents that uncertainty. A hierarchical Bayesian model can treat binding-site predictions as noisy evidence about latent TF-gene edges, with a source-reliability parameter and an expression-data likelihood. Conflicting evidence can lower posterior edge support; learning the source's reliability itself also requires an identifiable model and informative data, potentially including independent binding evidence or multiple priors. A Bayesian label alone does not supply this model.

No qualified registered workflow fully matches the requested modeling philosophy.

Outside this agent (reference only; it cannot run these):
- **TIGER** (netZooR, R) — Bayesian matrix factorization of expression with a prior TF-gene network and TF activities; sparse edge priors let the data shrink unsupported prior edges, one edge at a time. Chen & Padi 2024, doi:10.1038/s41540-024-00386-w.
- **Werhli & Husmeier (2007)** (published method, no NetZoo implementation) — Bayesian networks that give each prior-knowledge source its own weight, sampled by MCMC, so the data decide how much each prior counts. PMID 17542777.

A registered method with that philosophy estimates a different result:
- **BONOBO** — declared output: co-expression networks and matching p-value matrices (one per sample). BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

If you relax that requirement, these registered approaches can infer the requested network through different assumptions:

PANDA and OTTER tie only on the stated output and scope. This does not show that they are equally robust to a noisy motif prior; neither estimates its reliability as a posterior probability.

1. **PANDA** — Iterative message passing reconciles the motif seed with TF-TF interactions and gene co-expression, repeatedly revising TF-gene edge support across those networks. The edge weights summarize integrated evidence, not a posterior probability that the motif prior is reliable.

2. **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

For the probabilistic reliability estimate you asked for, the hierarchical model above remains the recommendation. If stable network scores would suffice instead, perturb or replace the motif prior and compare inferred edges against independent evidence. Neither algorithm is known from the stated facts to be more robust for your study.

**What your data allows.** PANDA and GIRAFFE also need an expression matrix, a motif prior and a PPI network; PUMA also needs an expression matrix, a motif prior, a PPI network and a miRNA list; OTTER also needs a motif prior, a PPI network and an expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

About "to predict drug response for cell lines we have not profiled.": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

All of them derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks, and iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **LIONESS-PANDA**, **LIONESS-PUMA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The user has sufficient data for each cell line to construct the regulatory networks.

Which regulator type should the network model: transcription factors, miRNA regulators, or both?

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PUMA**. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**LIONESS-DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q.

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

For your question ("identify differentially methylated regions"):
- **PANDA**, **PUMA** — Build one network per group on the same genes and priors, then compare edge weights or each regulator's targeting score (out-degree) between the group networks. Two aggregate networks give one value per edge per group: they show where the groups differ, but give no per-sample spread to test it. For a statistical test, use the per-sample (LIONESS) version and test between the groups.
- **LIONESS-PANDA**, **LIONESS-PUMA** — Each sample gets its own network, so each edge weight or targeting score can be tested between the groups across samples -- for example with a linear model such as limma.
- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**, **BONOBO** — Per-sample gene degree or edge weights can be compared between the groups or time points (paired when the same individuals give both).
- **COBRA** — Put the group label in COBRA's design matrix: it returns a co-expression component for that variable -- the part of each gene pair's co-expression associated with the group -- alongside components for any other covariates you include, such as batch.
- **DRAGON** — Build one network per group on the same features of both layers, then compare the cross-layer edges (the partial correlations between the two omics layers) between the group networks; two aggregate networks show where the groups differ but give no per-sample spread to test it.
- **LIONESS-DRAGON** — Each sample gets its own two-layer network; comparing the samples' edge weights between the groups or conditions (paired when the same individuals give both) shows which within- and cross-layer associations differ.
- **OTTER** — Build one network per group on the same genes and priors, then compare edge weights or each regulator's targeting score (out-degree) between the group networks. Two aggregate networks give one value per edge per group: they show where the groups differ, but give no per-sample spread to test it. For a statistical test, use a per-sample method such as LIONESS-PANDA and test between the groups.
- **GIRAFFE** — The activity matrix compares TF activity, not network wiring, between the conditions; test each TF's activity between them (paired when the same individuals give both).
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.
Note: Some component values fall outside -1 to 1; read them as contributions, not correlations. Deciding which gene pairs differ beyond chance is a separate analysis.
Note: Partial correlations are conditional on every other feature in both layers, so use the same feature set in every network you compare.
Note: A sample's edges are estimated from how removing it changes the cohort network, so they are relative to the cohort the network was built from.
Note: OTTER weights are on a different scale from PANDA's; compare OTTER networks only with other OTTER networks built with the same parameters.
Note: With p-value output, edges can be filtered per sample at a chosen confidence.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 64 tumors, 65 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a separate gene regulatory network for every individual cell" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

**What your data allows.** LIONESS-PANDA and PANDA also need a motif prior and a PPI network. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

You mentioned "48 patients". Whether that counts as a handful of samples or as dozens or more is your call for this study design; I do not map a sample count to these categories myself.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "one network where both TFs and miRNAs regulate genes" -- available from PUMA.

Selected path: **PUMA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level signed regulatory-effect network. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

**What your data allows.** Your request names only expression data. PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, OTTER and GIRAFFE also need a motif prior and a PPI network; PUMA and LIONESS-PUMA also need a motif prior, a PPI network and a miRNA list. With expression data alone, LIONESS-COEXPRESSION or BONOBO builds a gene-gene co-expression network (genes only, no regulator roles) instead. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

About "to predict drug response for cell lines we have not profiled.": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

All of them derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks, and iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **LIONESS-PANDA**, **LIONESS-PUMA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The expression, motif, and protein interaction data are sufficient to infer regulatory networks for each cell line.

Which regulator type should the network model: transcription factors, miRNA regulators, or both?

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each patient's regulatory network" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA or LIONESS-PUMA.
2. "to relate TF targeting to their lung function scores" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA or GIRAFFE's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: A statistical model outside NetZoo (e.g. limma, Cox), with multiple-testing correction; needs a clinical table keyed by sample ID.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 120 patients, 121 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a regulatory network in which long non-coding RNAs act as regulators of protein-coding genes" -- available from PUMA.

Based on what you said — "We want a regulatory network in which long non-coding RNAs act as regulators of protein-coding genes." — **PUMA** fits better: the regulators include miRNAs or similar short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade target transcripts after transcription.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** (recommend) — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list. Produces inferred regulator-to-target associations (one cohort-level result).

Conditional assumptions to confirm:
- This reads the molecules you describe as miRNAs. Confirm that, and that you have a miRNA-target prior and a list of the miRNAs, before analysis.
- This starting choice assumes a regulator scope of miRNA regulators, transcription factors; confirm this scope before analysis.
- It also needs a TF-motif prior and protein-interaction prior and miRNA list, which the request does not mention.
- The expression data includes relevant lncRNA and protein-coding gene information.

Other compatible option(s):
- If you need a TF-only regulatory network instead: **PANDA**, **OTTER**.
- **GIRAFFE** — preferred when: a regulator's activity may differ from its own expression, or activating versus repressing effects are needed; each sample's regulator activity level is needed, apart from the regulator's own expression; approach: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors.

Should I use PUMA, or does another listed option fit your study better?

Your question asks for a co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result.

**COBRA** — Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

What I understood you are asking for:

2. "to predict drug response for cell lines we have not profiled" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. No registered workflow fits a predictive or generative model; per-sample results can only be features for one built elsewhere.

About "to predict drug response for cell lines we have not profiled.": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

All of them derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks, and iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level signed regulatory-effect network. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PUMA also writes the cohort network, so PUMA need not run first.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**LIONESS-DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

**What your data allows.** LIONESS-PANDA and PANDA also need a motif prior and a PPI network. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression.

(yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each TF's activity per patient" -- available from GIRAFFE.
2. "to forecast how those activities will change next year" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. No registered workflow fits a predictive or generative model; per-sample results can only be features for one built elsewhere.

About "forecast how those activities will change next year": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The user has access to the necessary expression data and motif/protein interaction priors.

Fallback recommendation: **GIRAFFE**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** is related to that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "forecast how those activities will change next year" — The TF-by-sample activity matrix (TFA) can serve as predictors in association tests with sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. Relating per-sample results to sample-level variables needs an annotation or clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs, supplied separately. Signs in the regulatory matrix are partial linear effects (positive for activation, negative for repression); read them as model coefficients, not as proof of direct binding.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-DRAGON**.

You do not need to run **DRAGON** separately; **LIONESS-DRAGON** also produces the aggregate output. Use **DRAGON** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs DRAGON once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 DRAGON runs and give N network files (for your 70 patients, 71 DRAGON runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "the co-expression attributable to treatment after accounting for batch" -- available from COBRA.
2. "the list of differentially expressed genes" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. COBRA does not give it: COBRA decomposes gene-pair co-expression; it does not test single genes' expression.

Based on what you said — "We want the co-expression attributable to treatment after accounting for batch" — **COBRA** fits better: co-expression must be separated or adjusted for batch, site or other covariates.

Your question asks for a cohort-level co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result and scale.

**COBRA** (recommend) — COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern. Needs expression matrix and sample covariate design matrix. Produces inferred gene-to-gene associations (one cohort-level result).

Conditional assumptions to confirm:
- It also needs an expression matrix, which the request does not mention.

Other compatible option(s):
- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — preferred when: dozens of samples or more; no sample covariates need to be separated or adjusted; approach: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks.

Should I use COBRA, or does another listed option fit your study better?

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "patient subtypes from pathway mutation scores" -- available from SAMBAR.
2. "resolve each subtype at single-cell resolution" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. LIONESS-PANDA does not give it: built for bulk samples; per-cell co-expression is dominated by dropout.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**

Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription?

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

You mentioned "48 patients". Whether that counts as a handful of samples or as dozens or more is your call for this study design; I do not map a sample count to these categories myself.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

For your question ("compare peak overlap between the three factors"):
- **PANDA** — Build one network per group on the same genes and priors, then compare edge weights or each regulator's targeting score (out-degree) between the group networks. Two aggregate networks give one value per edge per group: they show where the groups differ, but give no per-sample spread to test it. For a statistical test, use the per-sample (LIONESS) version and test between the groups.
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Each sample gets its own network, so each edge weight or targeting score can be tested between the groups across samples -- for example with a linear model such as limma.
- **OTTER** — Build one network per group on the same genes and priors, then compare edge weights or each regulator's targeting score (out-degree) between the group networks. Two aggregate networks give one value per edge per group: they show where the groups differ, but give no per-sample spread to test it. For a statistical test, use a per-sample method such as LIONESS-PANDA and test between the groups.
- **GIRAFFE** — The activity matrix compares TF activity, not network wiring, between the conditions; test each TF's activity between them (paired when the same individuals give both).
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.
Note: OTTER weights are on a different scale from PANDA's; compare OTTER networks only with other OTTER networks built with the same parameters.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA.

Your request describes more than one scientific reading. Each is listed with the registered workflows that fit it, their algorithmic premises and inputs:

**Reading 1 -- "regulatory network"**
Result: regulatory networks (sample-specific), from inputs the request does not state.
- **TF-only regulatory network — PANDA → LIONESS-PANDA**
  - Registered purpose: Infer aggregate PANDA and sample-specific LIONESS-PANDA networks.
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks; iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow
  - Mathematical interpretation: LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.
  - Mathematical interpretation: Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
  - Declared output: regulatory networks (cohort-level aggregate; sample-specific, one network per sample).

**Reading 2 -- "relate TF targeting to their lung function scores"**
Result: regulatory networks (sample-specific), from inputs the request does not state.
- **TF-only regulatory network — PANDA → LIONESS-PANDA**
  - Registered purpose: Infer aggregate PANDA and sample-specific LIONESS-PANDA networks.

- **TF/miRNA regulatory network — PUMA → LIONESS-PUMA**

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.
  - Mathematical interpretation: PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression.
  - Mathematical interpretation: Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list.
  - Declared output: regulatory networks (cohort-level aggregate; sample-specific, one network per sample).

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a separate gene regulatory network for every individual cell" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

**What your data allows.** LIONESS-PANDA and PANDA also need a motif prior and a PPI network. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "one regulatory network for responders" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA, OTTER, PANDA, PUMA or GIRAFFE.
2. "one for non-responders" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA, OTTER, PANDA, PUMA or GIRAFFE.
3. "a permutation test giving a p-value for each edge that differs between the two networks" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA or DRAGON's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: A statistical model outside NetZoo (e.g. limma, Cox), with multiple-testing correction; needs a clinical table keyed by sample ID.

Yes, in principle, data can weaken an unreliable TF-binding prior and quantify uncertainty about it, but only if the model explicitly represents that uncertainty. A hierarchical Bayesian model can treat binding-site predictions as noisy evidence about latent TF-gene edges, with a source-reliability parameter and an expression-data likelihood. Conflicting evidence can lower posterior edge support; learning the source's reliability itself also requires an identifiable model and informative data, potentially including independent binding evidence or multiple priors. A Bayesian label alone does not supply this model.

No qualified registered workflow fully matches the requested modeling philosophy.

Outside this agent (reference only; it cannot run these):
- **TIGER** (netZooR, R) — Bayesian matrix factorization of expression with a prior TF-gene network and TF activities; sparse edge priors let the data shrink unsupported prior edges, one edge at a time. Chen & Padi 2024, doi:10.1038/s41540-024-00386-w.
- **Werhli & Husmeier (2007)** (published method, no NetZoo implementation) — Bayesian networks that give each prior-knowledge source its own weight, sampled by MCMC, so the data decide how much each prior counts. PMID 17542777.

A registered method with that philosophy estimates a different result:
- **BONOBO** — declared output: co-expression networks and matching p-value matrices (one per sample). BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

If you relax that requirement, these registered approaches can infer the requested network through different assumptions:

PANDA and OTTER tie only on the stated output and scope. This does not show that they are equally robust to a noisy motif prior; neither estimates its reliability as a posterior probability.

1. **PANDA** — Iterative message passing reconciles the motif seed with TF-TF interactions and gene co-expression, repeatedly revising TF-gene edge support across those networks. The edge weights summarize integrated evidence, not a posterior probability that the motif prior is reliable.

2. **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

For the probabilistic reliability estimate you asked for, the hierarchical model above remains the recommendation. If stable network scores would suffice instead, perturb or replace the motif prior and compare inferred edges against independent evidence. Neither algorithm is known from the stated facts to be more robust for your study.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "the co-expression attributable to treatment after accounting for batch" -- available from COBRA.
2. "the list of differentially expressed genes" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. COBRA does not give it: COBRA decomposes gene-pair co-expression; it does not test single genes' expression.

Based on what you said — "We want the co-expression attributable to treatment after accounting for batch" — **COBRA** fits better: co-expression must be separated or adjusted for batch, site or other covariates.

Your question asks for a cohort-level co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result and scale.

**COBRA** (recommend) — COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern. Needs expression matrix and sample covariate design matrix. Produces inferred gene-to-gene associations (one cohort-level result).

Conditional assumptions to confirm:
- It also needs an expression matrix, which the request does not mention.
- The expression data is available in a gene-by-sample format.
- A design file that specifies the covariates is available.

Other compatible option(s):
- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — preferred when: dozens of samples or more; no sample covariates need to be separated or adjusted; approach: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks.

Should I use COBRA, or does another listed option fit your study better?

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Which result do you mean: inferred regulator-to-target associations (PANDA or PUMA or LIONESS-PANDA or LIONESS-PUMA or OTTER or GIRAFFE); or network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels (CONDOR)?

About "to show these modules causally drive treatment resistance": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 64 tumors, 65 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a gene co-expression network for each patient" -- available from LIONESS-COEXPRESSION.
2. "that we can compare across patients" -- not matched to any registered workflow.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The analysis will be based solely on the available gene expression data from the 48 patients.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

You mentioned "48 patients". Whether that counts as a handful of samples or as dozens or more is your call for this study design; I do not map a sample count to these categories myself.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each TF's activity per patient" -- available from GIRAFFE.
2. "forecast how those activities will change next year" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. No registered workflow fits a predictive or generative model; per-sample results can only be features for one built elsewhere.

About "forecast how those activities will change next year": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality.

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**LIONESS-DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.

An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a regulatory network per cell line" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA or LIONESS-PUMA.
2. "to predict drug response for cell lines we have not profiled" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. No registered workflow fits a predictive or generative model; per-sample results can only be features for one built elsewhere.

About "to predict drug response for cell lines we have not profiled.": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

All of them derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks, and iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PUMA**. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**LIONESS-DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q.

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network.

**What your data allows.** Your request names only expression data. PUMA also needs a miRNA list. PANDA, PUMA, OTTER and GIRAFFE need a motif prior and a PPI network, which you said you do not have ("We have expression data and predicted lncRNA-target interactions.").

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

Full reply:

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level signed regulatory-effect network. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Full reply:

```
What I understood you are asking for:
1. "group the patients into subtypes based on which pathways are mutated" -- available from SAMBAR.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.

About "We want a mechanistic differential-equation model of the pathway and to fit its kinetic rate constants.": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

2. "to show these modules causally drive treatment resistance" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. Every registered workflow estimates associations or model coefficients from observational data.

About "to show these modules causally drive treatment resistance.": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The TF-gene network is already validated and available for analysis.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

**What your data allows.** Your request names only expression data. PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, OTTER and GIRAFFE also need a motif prior and a PPI network; PUMA and LIONESS-PUMA also need a motif prior, a PPI network and a miRNA list.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each patient's regulatory network" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA or LIONESS-PUMA.
2. "relate TF targeting to their lung function scores" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA or GIRAFFE's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: A statistical model outside NetZoo (e.g. limma, Cox), with multiple-testing correction; needs a clinical table keyed by sample ID.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 120 patients, 121 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PUMA also writes the cohort network, so PUMA need not run first.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**LIONESS-DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q.

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

About "forecast how those activities will change next year": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

Fallback recommendation: **GIRAFFE**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** is related to that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "forecast how those activities will change next year" — The TF-by-sample activity matrix (TFA) can serve as predictors in association tests with sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. Relating per-sample results to sample-level variables needs an annotation or clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs, supplied separately. Signs in the regulatory matrix are partial linear effects (positive for activation, negative for repression); read them as model coefficients, not as proof of direct binding.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Your question asks for a co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result.

What you asked about:

- "how much of the gene-gene co-expression in our 160 samples is explained by age, while adjusting for sex" — Each covariate's component is a gene-by-gene co-expression attributable to that covariate; the adjusted co-expression can be passed to PANDA, PUMA or OTTER as coexpression_file after its identifiers and order are revalidated. Interpret each component relative to how the design matrix codes that covariate (for example, which level is the reference).

**COBRA** — Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.

Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

You mentioned "48 patients". Whether that counts as a handful of samples or as dozens or more is your call for this study design; I do not map a sample count to these categories myself.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-DRAGON**.

Required inputs:
   - `omics_layer_1`: Omics layer 1 (samples x features)
   - `omics_layer_2`: Omics layer 2 (the same samples)

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **DRAGON** separately; **LIONESS-DRAGON** also produces the aggregate output. Use **DRAGON** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs DRAGON once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 DRAGON runs and give N network files (for your 70 patients, 71 DRAGON runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "patient subtypes from pathway mutation scores" -- available from SAMBAR.
2. "resolve each subtype at single-cell resolution" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. LIONESS-PANDA does not give it: built for bulk samples; per-cell co-expression is dominated by dropout.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a regulatory network in which long non-coding RNAs act as regulators of protein-coding genes" -- available from PUMA.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, GIRAFFE.

**What your data allows.** Your request names only expression data. PUMA also needs a miRNA list. PANDA, PUMA, OTTER and GIRAFFE need a motif prior and a PPI network, which you said you do not have ("we have expression data and predicted lncRNA-target interactions"). With expression data alone, LIONESS-COEXPRESSION builds one cohort-level gene-gene co-expression network (genes only, no regulator roles) instead.

1. "its communities of regulators and genes" -- available from CONDOR.
2. "to show these modules causally drive treatment resistance" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. Every registered workflow estimates associations or model coefficients from observational data.

About "to show these modules causally drive treatment resistance": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

**What your data allows.** LIONESS-PANDA and PANDA also need a motif prior and a PPI network. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

About "forecast how those activities will change next year": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "one network where both TFs and miRNAs regulate genes" -- available from PUMA.

Selected path: **PUMA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list. Produces inferred regulator-to-target associations (one cohort-level result).

Conditional assumptions to confirm:
- This reads the molecules you describe as miRNAs. Confirm that, and that you have a miRNA-target prior and a list of the miRNAs, before analysis.
- This starting choice assumes a regulator scope of miRNA regulators, transcription factors; confirm this scope before analysis.
- It also needs a TF-motif prior and protein-interaction prior and miRNA list, which the request does not mention.

Other compatible option(s):
- If you need a TF-only regulatory network instead: **PANDA**, **OTTER**.
- **GIRAFFE** — preferred when: a regulator's activity may differ from its own expression, or activating versus repressing effects are needed; each sample's regulator activity level is needed, apart from the regulator's own expression; approach: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors.

Should I use PUMA, or does another listed option fit your study better?

About "to show these modules causally drive treatment resistance": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**Gene co-expression network**
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable. Needs expression matrix.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges.

Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The user has the necessary data to construct the regulatory networks for both groups.
- The networks will be built based on the same underlying methodology for both responders and non-responders.
- The permutation test will be appropriately designed to compare the edges of the two regulatory networks.
- The user has access to the necessary computational resources to perform the permutation test.

Which result do you mean: inferred regulator-to-target associations, one cohort-wide result (PANDA or PUMA or OTTER or GIRAFFE); or p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result (BONOBO)?

**What your data allows.** PANDA and GIRAFFE also need an expression matrix, a motif prior and a PPI network; PUMA also needs an expression matrix, a motif prior, a PPI network and a miRNA list; OTTER also needs a motif prior, a PPI network and an expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix; BONOBO also needs an expression matrix.

About "want to predict its three-dimensional protein structure": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PUMA**. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.
