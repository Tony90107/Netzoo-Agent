> I've got whole-blood microarrays from 18 kidney transplant recipients, each sampled before surgery and three months after, plus TF motif and protein interaction priors. Which transcription factors shift their targets the most between the two draws?

### base r1

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA.

Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

For your question ("Which transcription factors shift their targets the most between the two draws?"):
- **PANDA**, **OTTER** — Comparing each regulator's targeting score (out-degree) between networks built separately for each condition shows regulators whose targeting changes. Without per-sample networks this ranks regulators by the size of the change, with no test of whether it exceeds chance.
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Per-sample targeting scores (out-degree) give a regulator-by-sample matrix; test each regulator between the conditions (paired when the same individuals give both), with multiple-testing correction across regulators.
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix gives each TF's activity in each sample; test each TF's activity between the conditions (paired when the same individuals give both), with multiple-testing correction.
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.
Note: OTTER weights are on a different scale from PANDA's; compare OTTER networks only with other OTTER networks built with the same parameters.

Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA.

Your request describes more than one scientific reading. Each is listed with the registered workflows that fit it, their algorithmic premises and inputs:

**Reading 1 -- "Are gene-gene relationships wired differently in the schizophrenia brains compared with controls?"**
Result: co-expression networks, from expression matrix.
- **Gene co-expression network — LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**
  - Registered purpose: Infer aggregate and sample-specific co-expression networks with LIONESS.
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks
  - Mathematical interpretation: LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix.
  - Declared output: co-expression networks (cohort-level aggregate; sample-specific, one network per sample).
- **Gene co-expression network — COBRA**
  - Registered purpose: Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA.
  - Method premise: remove or adjust technical batch effects; estimate how sample covariates change co-expression
  - Mathematical interpretation: COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix.
  - Declared output: co-expression networks (cohort-level aggregate).
- **Gene co-expression network — BONOBO**
  - Registered purpose: Infer sample-specific gene-gene co-expression networks with netZooPy BONOBO.
  - Method premise: Bayesian shrinkage estimation of sample-specific co-expression; sparsify sample-specific co-expression and return matching p-value matrices
  - Mathematical interpretation: BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **PANDA**, **PUMA**, **OTTER** — Targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree or a gene's indegree summarizes the network per regulator or per gene; comparing them between networks built separately for each condition shows regulators whose targeting changes. Comparing conditions needs one run per condition on matched inputs (the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors); edge weights are comparable only within that shared setup.
- **PANDA** — For per-sample scores to test against clinical variables, use LIONESS-PANDA instead.
- **PUMA** — For per-sample scores to test against clinical variables, use LIONESS-PUMA instead.
- **LIONESS-PANDA**, **LIONESS-PUMA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.
- **OTTER** — OTTER weights are on a different scale from PANDA's; compare OTTER networks only with other OTTER networks built with the same parameters.
- **GIRAFFE** — The TF-by-sample activity matrix (TFA) can serve as predictors in association tests with sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. Relating per-sample results to sample-level variables needs an annotation or clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs, supplied separately. Signs in the regulatory matrix are partial linear effects (positive for activation, negative for repression); read them as model coefficients, not as proof of direct binding.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- No scale was stated; PUMA gives one result for the whole cohort; LIONESS-PUMA gives one result for the whole cohort or one result per sample.

Fallback recommendation: **PUMA**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a regulatory network. **PUMA** is related to that result.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PUMA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network
   - `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PUMA** separately; **LIONESS-PUMA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PUMA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PUMA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PUMA runs and give N network files (for your 120 tumors, 121 PUMA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

All of them derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks.

**Multi omic network**
- **LIONESS-DRAGON** — DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. Needs DRAGON omics layer 1 and DRAGON omics layer 2.

- **LIONESS-PANDA** gives a TF-by-sample out-degree matrix -- each TF's summed edge weights to its targets in each sample's network (how strongly the TF is wired).
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks; iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
- **LIONESS-PUMA** gives the same out-degree matrix with miRNAs among the regulators (needs a miRNA list).

  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list.
- **GIRAFFE** gives its TF-by-sample activity matrix -- how active each TF is apart from its own mRNA level, a different reading from wiring.
  - Method premise: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors; jointly infer a TF-gene regulatory matrix and a TF-by-sample activity matrix
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
- **BONOBO** gives one gene co-expression network per sample; with about genes-squared edges each, summarize them first (for example per-gene degree).
  - Method premise: Bayesian shrinkage estimation of sample-specific co-expression; sparsify sample-specific co-expression and return matching p-value matrices
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix.
- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** gives one gene co-expression network per sample, summarized the same way.
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix.
Clustering the samples on that matrix (for example hierarchical clustering or k-means) is not a NetZoo workflow; run it separately.
Per-sample networks from LIONESS are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.
Clusters are unsupervised: whether they predict an outcome such as treatment response has to be tested against that outcome, keyed by the same sample IDs.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

Your request does not say what the network should connect; the options above assume regulator-to-target associations. Every option above also needs a TF-motif prior and a protein-interaction prior. If you meant gene-to-gene associations, **BONOBO** and **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** need only the input you named.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PUMA**. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality.

The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**LIONESS-DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q.

With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PUMA**. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

About "Our hope is to establish that methylation changes drive the expression response to treatment.": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The analysis will utilize both RNA-seq and DNA methylation data from the same patients.
- The goal is to understand the impact of methylation on gene expression in response to treatment.
- No scale was stated; DRAGON gives one result for the whole cohort; LIONESS-DRAGON gives one result per sample.

Fallback recommendation: **DRAGON**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a multi-omic network. **DRAGON** is related to that result.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

About "Our hope is to establish that methylation changes drive the expression response to treatment.": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**Multi omic network**
- **DRAGON** — DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-DRAGON**. Needs DRAGON omics layer 1 and DRAGON omics layer 2.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The analysis will focus on the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression.
- The data from the 20 patients will be used to infer the multi-omic network.
- The regulatory network will be inferred based on the changes observed in the methylation and expression data.
- The analysis will consider the time points before and after treatment.

Which result do you mean: inferred associations between omics features (DRAGON or LIONESS-DRAGON); or inferred regulator-to-target associations (PANDA or PUMA or LIONESS-PANDA or LIONESS-PUMA or OTTER or GIRAFFE)?

**What your data allows.** Your request names only expression data. DRAGON and LIONESS-DRAGON need omics layer 1 and omics layer 2; PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, OTTER and GIRAFFE also need a motif prior and a PPI network; PUMA and LIONESS-PUMA also need a motif prior, a PPI network and a miRNA list. With expression data alone, LIONESS-COEXPRESSION or BONOBO builds a gene-gene co-expression network (genes only, no regulator roles) instead. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

About "Our hope is to establish that methylation changes drive the expression response to treatment.": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The analysis will involve both RNA-seq and DNA methylation data from the same patients.
- The goal is to understand how methylation changes influence gene expression in response to treatment.
- No scale was stated; DRAGON gives one result for the whole cohort; LIONESS-DRAGON gives one result per sample.

Fallback recommendation: **DRAGON**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a multi-omic network. **DRAGON** is related to that result.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

About "From the baseline biopsy alone, we'd like to forecast which future patients will reach remission.": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**LIONESS-PANDA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

About "From the baseline biopsy alone, we'd like to forecast which future patients will reach remission.": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

Fallback recommendation: **DRAGON**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** is related to that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges.

Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription?

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription?

Here is how registered workflows can reach this result, with their algorithmic premises and inputs:

Result: sample cluster assignment (aggregate), from expression matrix.
No registered workflow assigns samples to clusters from expression. A registered workflow can give each sample a feature profile to cluster on:
- **LIONESS-PANDA** gives a TF-by-sample out-degree matrix -- each TF's summed edge weights to its targets in each sample's network (how strongly the TF is wired).
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks; iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
- **LIONESS-PUMA** gives the same out-degree matrix with miRNAs among the regulators (needs a miRNA list).
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks; iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list.
- **GIRAFFE** gives its TF-by-sample activity matrix -- how active each TF is apart from its own mRNA level, a different reading from wiring.
  - Method premise: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors; jointly infer a TF-gene regulatory matrix and a TF-by-sample activity matrix
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
- **BONOBO** gives one gene co-expression network per sample; with about genes-squared edges each, summarize them first (for example per-gene degree).
  - Method premise: Bayesian shrinkage estimation of sample-specific co-expression; sparsify sample-specific co-expression and return matching p-value matrices
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix.
- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** gives one gene co-expression network per sample, summarized the same way.
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix.
Clustering the samples on that matrix (for example hierarchical clustering or k-means) is not a NetZoo workflow; run it separately.
Per-sample networks from LIONESS are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.
Clusters are unsupervised: whether they predict an outcome such as treatment response has to be tested against that outcome, keyed by the same sample IDs.

Which per-sample profile should we start with: LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA, GIRAFFE, BONOBO or LIONESS-COEXPRESSION?
