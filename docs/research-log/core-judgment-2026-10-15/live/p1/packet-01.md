What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Can CONDOR find communities in network_final.tsv, which a postdoc left behind when he moved on?" -- available from CONDOR.
2. "I don't know whether it's the TF-to-gene regulatory network from his PANDA runs or the gene-gene co-expression network he also built." -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

I cannot select a workflow until the requested result is clear. I could not validate every research alternative. Please state each hypothesis and the result you want from it before selecting a workflow.

! Fallback recommendation — not an exact semantic match
✓ Guidance prepared
Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- No scale was stated; PUMA gives one result for the whole cohort; LIONESS-PUMA gives one result for the whole cohort or one result per sample.

Fallback candidate: **PUMA**, if you have a miRNA list. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a regulatory network. **PUMA** is related to that result.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Now I want to split it into communities of TFs and their target genes, with the TF-side and gene-side memberships reported separately." -- available from CONDOR.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

BONOBO: Infer sample-specific gene-gene co-expression networks with netZooPy BONOBO.

Registered workflow controls: bonobo_output_format (type=enum, default='.h5'), sample_names (type=string_list, default=[]), sparsify (type=boolean, default=False), bonobo_confidence (type=number, default=0.05), save_pvals (type=boolean, default=False), precision (type=enum, default='single'), keep_in_memory (type=boolean, default=False), delta (type=number, default=None), genes_axis (type=enum, default='auto'), log_transformed (type=boolean, default=None), centered (type=boolean, default=None).
Output: one gene-gene co-expression network per selected sample.
This is a co-expression result, not a regulatory network (TF/miRNA) or a covariance-decomposition artifact.
When `sparsify=False` and `save_pvals=False`: full sample-specific gene-gene co-expression matrices; no p-value artifact is written.
When `sparsify=True` and `save_pvals=False`: upstream thresholds each sample-specific co-expression matrix; no p-value artifact is written.
When `sparsify=True` and `save_pvals=True`: upstream retains the full co-expression matrix for each selected sample and writes a matching p-value matrix; threshold it from the saved p-value matrix; it does not also emit an already-thresholded network in this mode.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

No registered workflow produces these as you asked them, so none is offered for them as asked. The note below describes the closest route.

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Can PANDA build a single TF-to-gene regulatory network for our whole cohort of 48 mouse liver RNA-seq samples?" -- available from PANDA.

Selected path: **PANDA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PANDA** fits that result and scale.

**PANDA** — Infer an aggregate TF-to-gene regulatory network with PANDA. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Request: Can SAMBAR subtype our 160 pediatric medulloblastomas? The sequencing core sent a samples-by-genes variant-count matrix along with gene lengths, a cancer-gene list and a KEGG GMT, but their README doesn't say whether the counts are tumour-only somatic mutations or germline variant calls, and I can't tell from the file itself.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Can SAMBAR subtype our 160 pediatric medulloblastomas?" -- available from SAMBAR.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Gene length normalization addresses the greater opportunity for mutations in longer genes; gene/exon sizes are therefore required, not just the mutation matrix.

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

I can't tell yet which result you want, so I have not chosen a workflow.

The registered workflows give these results:
- One weighted TF-to-gene regulatory network across all the samples given (PANDA)
- One weighted network of how TFs and miRNAs regulate genes, across all samples (PUMA)
- One TF-gene network per sample, plus the aggregate network (LIONESS-PANDA)
- One TF/miRNA-gene network per sample, plus the aggregate network (LIONESS-PUMA)
- One gene-gene co-expression network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-COEXPRESSION)
- Communities in one bipartite network, with regulator-side and gene-side memberships, by bipartite modularity (CONDOR)
- The part of each gene pair's co-expression associated with each covariate in a design matrix (e.g. group, batch), and a covariate-adjusted co-expression matrix (COBRA)
- Patient subtypes from somatic mutations -- gene mutation scores summarized into pathway mutation scores, then hierarchical clustering of the patients on them... (SAMBAR)
- One undirected partial-correlation network within and between two matched omics layers (any two, e.g. expression and methylation), across all samples (DRAGON)
- One two-layer partial-correlation network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-DRAGON)
- One weighted TF-to-gene regulatory network across all samples, fitted so that it agrees with the PPI network and gene co-expression (OTTER)
- A signed TF-to-gene regulatory matrix (positive activating, negative repressing), across all samples (GIRAFFE)
- One gene-gene co-expression network per sample, estimated with a Bayesian model; optionally per-edge p-values per sample (BONOBO)

1. "see how much of each gene pair's co-expression is associated with sequencing run versus sex" -- available from COBRA.
2. "get an adjusted gene-by-gene co-expression matrix out of it for later network work" -- available from COBRA.

Selected path: **COBRA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result and scale. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation.

Captured request parameters:

- `expression_file`: sample

What you asked about:

- "get an adjusted gene-by-gene co-expression matrix out of it for later network work" — Each covariate's component is a gene-by-gene co-expression attributable to that covariate; the adjusted co-expression can be passed to PANDA, PUMA or OTTER as coexpression_file after its identifiers and order are revalidated. Interpret each component relative to how the design matrix codes that covariate (for example, which level is the reference).

**COBRA**: Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA.

Routing-level input modality: expression matrix.

Method premise: remove or adjust technical batch effects; estimate how sample covariates change co-expression; model higher-order covariance or correlation structure; assess or remove hospital or site effects; assess or remove sequencing-batch effects.

COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `design_file`: sample covariate design matrix

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

- `coexpression_network`: Inferred gene-to-gene associations.

## S233702

Request: I'd like one regulatory network for my 70 colorectal tumours in which both transcription factors and microRNAs act as regulators of their target genes. I have the gene-by-sample expression matrix, a TF motif prior, a TF-TF PPI, a miRNA-target prior and a file listing the miRNAs, one ID per line, all of which appear in the prior. Nothing per-patient is needed; a single cohort-level network is what goes into the paper.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "I'd like one regulatory network for my 70 colorectal tumours in which both transcription factors and microRNAs act as regulators of their target genes." -- available from PUMA.
2. "a single cohort-level network is what goes into the paper" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. Every registered workflow writes result files to the output folder you give; sending, uploading, publishing or showing them is done outside NetZoo.

Selected path: **PUMA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators.

Captured request parameters:

- `network_file`: for

**PUMA**: Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA.

Routing-level input modality: gene expression, coexpression.

Method premise: iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow.

PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression.

Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

Request: Can BONOBO run with sparsify on at a 0.01 confidence level and delta fixed at 0.5 for my 18 log-transformed, centered endometriosis samples?

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "sparsify on at a 0.01 confidence level and delta fixed at 0.5 for my 18" -- not available here as asked. BONOBO: with sparsify, delta must be above 0 and below 1/3, got 0.5. BONOBO itself can still run, with its own settings instead -- an alternative, not the setting you asked for.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.
