What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Run OTTER on expr_t2d_islets.tsv, seed_W.tsv and ppi_tf.tsv with lam set to 1.5, so co-expression gets even more weight than PPI." -- not available here as asked. OTTER's lam must be between 0 and 1; "1.5" is not. OTTER itself can still run, with its own settings instead -- an alternative, not the setting you asked for.

You asked me to run OTTER, but it cannot run as you asked (above), so the run would not do what you asked. I have not planned it.

Tell me to run OTTER anyway, and I will then find your input files and show a preview; nothing runs until you approve it.

No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

What I want is a separate network for every patient that links miRNAs and cytokines through partial correlations, within and across the two layers, so I can compare survivors with non-survivors patient by patient afterwards.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a separate network for every patient that links miRNAs and cytokines through partial correlations, within and across the two layers" -- available from LIONESS-DRAGON.

Selected path: **LIONESS-DRAGON**.

**LIONESS-DRAGON** — Infer one sample-specific two-layer multi-omic partial-correlation network per sample with LIONESS-DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Cost: LIONESS runs DRAGON once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 DRAGON runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- LIONESS-DRAGON estimates DRAGON's two shrinkage values once on all samples, then derives each sample's network from the all-sample network and the network refitted without that sample.
- Each sample's network is an undirected partial-correlation graph across both layers; like DRAGON's, it is an association graph, not a causal one.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

For your question ("compare survivors with non-survivors patient by patient afterwards"):
- **LIONESS-DRAGON** — Each sample gets its own two-layer network; comparing the samples' edge weights between the groups or conditions (paired when the same individuals give both) shows which within- and cross-layer associations differ.
Note: A sample's edges are estimated from how removing it changes the cohort network, so they are relative to the cohort the network was built from.
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

For our 52 rice leaf samples from the drought trial I want a learning rate of 1e-4, 2,000 iterations and a heavier weight on the PPI term in the loss, because in a pilot the package defaults gave a TF activity matrix that looked over-smoothed and I'd like to see whether these settings change that.

I can't tell yet which result you want, so I have not chosen a workflow.

The registered workflows give these results:
- One weighted TF-to-gene regulatory network across all the samples given (PANDA)
- One weighted network of how TFs and miRNAs regulate genes, across all samples (PUMA)
- One TF-gene network per sample, plus the aggregate network (LIONESS-PANDA)
- One TF/miRNA-gene network per sample, plus the aggregate network (LIONESS-PUMA)
- One gene-gene co-expression network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-COEXPRESSION)
- Communities in one bipartite network, with regulator-side and gene-side memberships, by bipartite modularity (CONDOR)
- The part of each gene pair's co-expression associated with each covariate in a design matrix (e.g. group, batch), and a covariate-adjusted co-expression matrix (COBRA)
- Patient subtypes from somatic mutations -- gene mutation scores summarized into pathway mutation scores, then hierarchical clustering of the patients on them... (SAMBAR)
- One undirected partial-correlation network within and between two matched omics layers (any two, e.g. expression and methylation), across all samples (DRAGON)
- One two-layer partial-correlation network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-DRAGON)
- One weighted TF-to-gene regulatory network across all samples, fitted so that it agrees with the PPI network and gene co-expression (OTTER)
- A signed TF-to-gene regulatory matrix (positive activating, negative repressing), across all samples (GIRAFFE)
- One gene-gene co-expression network per sample, estimated with a Bayesian model; optionally per-edge p-values per sample (BONOBO)

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "I'd like a systems-level view of what is going on in these animals." -- available from DRAGON.
2. "Where should we start?" -- not matched to any registered workflow.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Request: I'd like a network of how about 150 regulators control their target genes across 60 hepatocellular carcinoma samples. I have the expression matrix, a PPI among those regulators, and a regulator-to-target prior from a collaborator's project, but that project studied both RNA-binding proteins and transcription factors, and I'm not sure which of the two lists I was given.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a network of how about 150 regulators control their target genes across 60 hepatocellular carcinoma samples" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

Routing matched these registered workflows to your words, but the capability check did not confirm that any of them gives what you asked for:
- **PUMA** — produces: One weighted network of how TFs and miRNAs regulate genes, across all samples.

Compare what each produces with what you asked for. Ask again to re-run the check, or say which result you want and from which workflow.

**Data your question needs.** Your question needs a motif prior, a PPI network and a miRNA list, which your request does not mention. Do you have a motif prior, a PPI network and a miRNA list?

## S156564

Request: Can I add an L1 (lasso) sparsity penalty to OTTER's objective so that the TF-gene network it returns for my 45 bovine mammary gland samples is sparse, with most edges exactly zero?

Complete recorded stdout:
````text

● Matching registered workflows…
✓ Guidance prepared
What I understood you are asking for:
1. "the TF-gene network it returns for my 45 bovine mammary gland samples is sparse, with most edges exactly zero" -- not available here as asked. NetZoo's OTTER has no setting for "L1 (lasso) sparsity penalty"; the settings it passes are output_format, computing, precision, lam, gamma, iterations, eta and bexp. OTTER itself can still run, with its own settings instead -- an alternative, not the setting you asked for.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA.

**What your data allows.** PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA and GIRAFFE also need an expression matrix, a motif prior and a PPI network; OTTER also needs a motif prior, a PPI network and an expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

Request: Can SAMBAR subtype our 210 hepatocellular carcinomas from the RNA-seq expression matrix? We don't have mutation calls for this cohort, only expression.

Complete recorded stdout:
````text
● Classifying requested outcome…
✓ Interpreted requested outcome (3.82s)

✓ Workflow — SAMBAR
✓ Guidance prepared
What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Can SAMBAR subtype our 210 hepatocellular carcinomas from the RNA-seq expression matrix?" -- available from SAMBAR.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

Our lab has bulk transcriptomics, proteomics and some ATAC-seq peaks for a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, roughly 30 animals across three time points. Which of these should we apply, and what would we actually learn from each? We haven't settled on a specific hypothesis yet, and our PI wants something to show at the next lab meeting.

I can't tell yet which result you want, so I have not chosen a workflow.

The registered workflows give these results:
- One weighted TF-to-gene regulatory network across all the samples given (PANDA)
- One weighted network of how TFs and miRNAs regulate genes, across all samples (PUMA)
- One TF-gene network per sample, plus the aggregate network (LIONESS-PANDA)
- One TF/miRNA-gene network per sample, plus the aggregate network (LIONESS-PUMA)
- One gene-gene co-expression network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-COEXPRESSION)
- Communities in one bipartite network, with regulator-side and gene-side memberships, by bipartite modularity (CONDOR)
- The part of each gene pair's co-expression associated with each covariate in a design matrix (e.g. group, batch), and a covariate-adjusted co-expression matrix (COBRA)
- Patient subtypes from somatic mutations -- gene mutation scores summarized into pathway mutation scores, then hierarchical clustering of the patients on them... (SAMBAR)
- One undirected partial-correlation network within and between two matched omics layers (any two, e.g. expression and methylation), across all samples (DRAGON)
- One two-layer partial-correlation network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-DRAGON)
- One weighted TF-to-gene regulatory network across all samples, fitted so that it agrees with the PPI network and gene co-expression (OTTER)
- A signed TF-to-gene regulatory matrix (positive activating, negative repressing), across all samples (GIRAFFE)
- One gene-gene co-expression network per sample, estimated with a Bayesian model; optionally per-edge p-values per sample (BONOBO)

Which of these results do you want, or what question should the analysis answer? And what data do you have (for example expression, motif and PPI priors, miRNAs, mutations, or a second omics layer)?

Nothing was selected and nothing runs before you answer.

Request: We ran a 48-gene NanoString inflammation panel on 600 rheumatoid arthritis patients recruited at four hospitals. I want to know how much of the co-expression between those 48 genes is associated with the hospital each sample came from, decomposed per covariate, with hospital coded as numeric indicator columns in a design table whose rows match the sample IDs exactly; each hospital contributed roughly 150 patients.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "I want to know how much of the co-expression between those 48 genes is associated with the hospital each sample came from, decomposed per covariate, with hospital coded as numeric indicator columns in a design table whose rows match the sample IDs exactly; each hospital contributed roughly 150 patients." -- available from COBRA.

Selected path: **COBRA**.

**COBRA** — Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `design_file`: sample covariate design matrix

Outputs:

- `coexpression_network`: Inferred gene-to-gene associations.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

Request: For each of our 25 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients I need that patient's own TF-to-gene regulatory network, built from the cohort's expression matrix together with a human motif prior and a TF PPI, so I can later compare each TF's targeting between responders and non-responders.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "that patient's own TF-to-gene regulatory network" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.
2. "built from the cohort's expression matrix together with a human motif prior and a TF PPI" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.
3. "so I can later compare each TF's targeting between responders and non-responders" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: Sum edge weights per TF per sample from the edge-by-sample table; NetZoo does not compute it.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **PANDA**, **OTTER** — Targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree or a gene's indegree summarizes the network per regulator or per gene; comparing them between networks built separately for each condition shows regulators whose targeting changes. Comparing conditions needs one run per condition on matched inputs (the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors); edge weights are comparable only within that shared setup.
- **PANDA** — For per-sample scores to test against clinical variables, use LIONESS-PANDA instead.
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.
- **OTTER** — OTTER weights are on a different scale from PANDA's; compare OTTER networks only with other OTTER networks built with the same parameters.
- **GIRAFFE** — The TF-by-sample activity matrix (TFA) can serve as predictors in association tests with sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. Relating per-sample results to sample-level variables needs an annotation or clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs, supplied separately. Signs in the regulatory matrix are partial linear effects (positive for activation, negative for repression); read them as model coefficients, not as proof of direct binding.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA.
