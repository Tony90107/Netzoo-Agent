Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage.

Captured request parameters:

- `network_file`: an

**DRAGON**: Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON.

Routing-level input modality: multi omic continuous.

Method premise: infer conditional associations using partial correlation.

DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Other declared controls (not matched to this request; defaults apply unless you set them): `output_format`=matrix, `lambda1`, `lambda2`.

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Can GIRAFFE estimate an activity score for every transcription factor in each of our 30 psoriasis skin samples?" -- available from GIRAFFE.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

## S946284

Request: For each of our 40 kidney cancer patients I need one number per transcription factor that captures that TF's regulatory strength in that patient, so we can relate it to survival. We have expression, a motif prior and a TF-TF PPI. I'm honestly not sure whether 'regulatory strength' here should mean how strongly the TF is wired to its targets or how active the TF is; my PI used both phrasings.

## S795233

Request: Reviewers asked for 'a network analysis' of our placenta study. We have mRNA-seq and small-RNA-seq from 45 preeclampsia and control placentas. Honestly I don't know what kind of network they expect or what it's supposed to show. The two groups are roughly balanced and both libraries come from the same placentas; can you set something up that would satisfy them?

I can't tell yet which result you want, so I have not chosen a workflow.

The registered workflows give these results:
- One weighted TF-to-gene regulatory network across all the samples given (PANDA)
- One weighted network of how TFs and miRNAs regulate genes, across all samples (PUMA)
- One TF-gene network per sample, plus the aggregate network (LIONESS-PANDA)
- One TF/miRNA-gene network per sample, plus the aggregate network (LIONESS-PUMA)
- One gene-gene co-expression network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-COEXPRESSION)
- Communities in one bipartite network, with regulator-side and gene-side memberships, by bipartite modularity (CONDOR)
- The part of each gene pair's co-expression associated with each covariate in a design matrix (e.g. group, batch), and a covariate-adjusted co-expression matrix (COBRA)
- Patient subtypes from somatic mutations -- gene mutation scores summarized into pathway mutation scores, then hierarchical clustering of the patients on them... (SAMBAR)
- One undirected partial-correlation network within and between two matched omics layers (any two, e.g. expression and methylation), across all samples (DRAGON)
- One two-layer partial-correlation network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-DRAGON)
- One weighted TF-to-gene regulatory network across all samples, fitted so that it agrees with the PPI network and gene co-expression (OTTER)
- A signed TF-to-gene regulatory matrix (positive activating, negative repressing), across all samples (GIRAFFE)
- One gene-gene co-expression network per sample, estimated with a Bayesian model; optionally per-edge p-values per sample (BONOBO)

Which of these results do you want, or what question should the analysis answer? And what data do you have (for example expression, motif and PPI priors, miRNAs, mutations, or a second omics layer)?

Nothing was selected and nothing runs before you answer.

No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

Request: Run the TF network inference on expr_alzheimer.tsv (88 donors: 44 AD, 44 controls), motifs_hg38.txt and ppi_tf.txt. The analysis plan just says 'a network for each AD and control', and I can't tell if that means one network per diagnostic group or one network per donor; the person who wrote it is on leave until next month.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Run the TF network inference" -- available from PANDA, PUMA, OTTER, GIRAFFE, LIONESS-PANDA or LIONESS-PUMA.
2. "one network per diagnostic group" -- you have not chosen which result you want: if "one network per diagnostic group": no registered workflow gives this; if "one network per donor": LIONESS-PANDA.
3. "one network per donor" -- you have not chosen which result you want: if "one network per diagnostic group": no registered workflow gives this; if "one network per donor": LIONESS-PANDA.
