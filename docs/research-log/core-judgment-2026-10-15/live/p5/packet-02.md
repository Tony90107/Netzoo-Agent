What I understood you are asking for:
1. "What I want is a separate network for every patient that links miRNAs and cytokines through partial correlations, within and across the two layers" -- available from LIONESS-DRAGON.

Selected path: **LIONESS-DRAGON**.

**LIONESS-DRAGON** — Infer one sample-specific two-layer multi-omic partial-correlation network per sample with LIONESS-DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Cost: LIONESS runs DRAGON once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 DRAGON runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- LIONESS-DRAGON estimates DRAGON's two shrinkage values once on all samples, then derives each sample's network from the all-sample network and the network refitted without that sample.
- Each sample's network is an undirected partial-correlation graph across both layers; like DRAGON's, it is an association graph, not a causal one.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

For your question ("compare survivors with non-survivors patient by patient afterwards"):
- **LIONESS-DRAGON** — Each sample gets its own two-layer network; comparing the samples' edge weights between the groups or conditions (paired when the same individuals give both) shows which within- and cross-layer associations differ.
Note: A sample's edges are estimated from how removing it changes the cohort network, so they are relative to the cohort the network was built from.
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

## S803507

Request: Can GIRAFFE be run with my own optimizer settings? For our 52 rice leaf samples from the drought trial I want a learning rate of 1e-4, 2,000 iterations and a heavier weight on the PPI term in the loss, because in a pilot the package defaults gave a TF activity matrix that looked over-smoothed and I'd like to see whether these settings change that.

✓ Guidance prepared
What I understood you are asking for:
1. "TF activity matrix" -- available from GIRAFFE.
2. "learning rate of 1e-4" -- not available here as asked. NetZoo runs GIRAFFE with its package defaults and passes no settings to it, so "learning rate of 1e-4" cannot be applied.
3. "2,000 iterations" -- not available here as asked. NetZoo runs GIRAFFE with its package defaults and passes no settings to it, so "2,000 iterations" cannot be applied.
4. "a heavier weight on the PPI term in the loss" -- not available here as asked. NetZoo runs GIRAFFE with its package defaults and passes no settings to it, so "a heavier weight on the PPI term in the loss" cannot be applied.

**GIRAFFE** fits the result you describe if you have a motif prior and a PPI network.

What you asked about:

- "I want a learning rate of 1e-4, 2,000 iterations and a heavier weight on the PPI term in the loss" — The TF-by-sample activity matrix (TFA) can serve as predictors in association tests with sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. Relating per-sample results to sample-level variables needs an annotation or clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs, supplied separately. Signs in the regulatory matrix are partial linear effects (positive for activation, negative for repression); read them as model coefficients, not as proof of direct binding.

**GIRAFFE**: Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression.

Routing-level input modality: expression matrix.

Method premise: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors; jointly infer a TF-gene regulatory matrix and a TF-by-sample activity matrix; interpret TF-gene regulatory weights as coefficients in a linear expression model; estimate positive activating and negative inhibitory partial regulatory effects; model gene expression with transcription factor activities as predictors.

GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "I want a transcript-metabolite partial-correlation network" -- available from DRAGON.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

For “batch-corrected expression matrix”, no registered workflow meets the stated requirement. That part needs a clearer measurement or an external method.

No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

What measurement would let you distinguish the remaining explanation?

I can't tell yet which result you want, so I have not chosen a workflow.

The registered workflows give these results:

- One gene-gene co-expression network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-COEXPRESSION)
- Communities in one bipartite network, with regulator-side and gene-side memberships, by bipartite modularity (CONDOR)
- The part of each gene pair's co-expression associated with each covariate in a design matrix (e.g. group, batch), and a covariate-adjusted co-expression matrix (COBRA)
- Patient subtypes from somatic mutations -- gene mutation scores summarized into pathway mutation scores, then hierarchical clustering of the patients on them... (SAMBAR)
- One undirected partial-correlation network within and between two matched omics layers (any two, e.g. expression and methylation), across all samples (DRAGON)
- One two-layer partial-correlation network per sample, plus the aggregate (LIONESS-DRAGON)
- One weighted TF-to-gene regulatory network across all samples, fitted so that it agrees with the PPI network and gene co-expression (OTTER)

Request: Can GIRAFFE give us signed TF-to-gene effects, activation versus repression, for our 40 atopic dermatitis skin biopsies? We have expression, a motif prior and a TF PPI. My supervisor's notes say we need those signed effects for each biopsy separately, but the grant text says one set of signed effects for the whole cohort, and I'm not sure which she actually wants.

## S882040

Request: For each of our 25 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients I need that patient's own TF-to-gene regulatory network, built from the cohort's expression matrix together with a human motif prior and a TF PPI, so I can later compare each TF's targeting between responders and non-responders.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "that patient's own TF-to-gene regulatory network" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.
2. "built from the cohort's expression matrix together with a human motif prior and a TF PPI, so I can later compare each TF's targeting between responders and non-responders" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **PANDA**, **OTTER** — Targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree or a gene's indegree summarizes the network per regulator or per gene; comparing them between networks built separately for each condition shows regulators whose targeting changes. Comparing conditions needs one run per condition on matched inputs (the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors); edge weights are comparable only within that shared setup.
- **PANDA** — For per-sample scores to test against clinical variables, use LIONESS-PANDA instead.
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.
- **OTTER** — OTTER weights are on a different scale from PANDA's; compare OTTER networks only with other OTTER networks built with the same parameters.
- **GIRAFFE** — The TF-by-sample activity matrix (TFA) can serve as predictors in association tests with sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. Relating per-sample results to sample-level variables needs an annotation or clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs, supplied separately. Signs in the regulatory matrix are partial linear effects (positive for activation, negative for repression); read them as model coefficients, not as proof of direct binding.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA.
