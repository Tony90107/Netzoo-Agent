What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Run OTTER with seed_W_mm.tsv, ppi_tf_mm.tsv and coexp_liver.tsv" -- depends on whether you want one result for all samples or one per sample, which you said you do not know ("I can't remember if coexp_liver.tsv is the full gene-by-gene correlation matrix for the cohort or the edge-by-sample table from our earlier LIONESS co-expression run."): if one for all samples: OTTER; if one per sample: no registered workflow gives this.

Before I choose a workflow, please tell me: Do you want one result for all your samples together, or one per sample?

No workflow has been selected and nothing runs before you answer.

The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; nothing it found is confirmed.

You asked me to run SAMBAR, but the capability check could not confirm this turn that SAMBAR gives what you asked for. I have not planned the run.

Tell me to run SAMBAR anyway, and I will then find your input files and show a preview; nothing runs until you approve it.

? Clarification needed
What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Run PANDA on expr_ipf.tsv with motif_hg38.tsv and ppi_hs.tsv, but use cobra_out/adjusted_coexpression.tsv (COBRA's adjusted gene-by-gene matrix, already checked to have the same gene IDs and order as the expression file) as the co-expression input instead of PANDA's own Pearson correlation." -- available from PANDA.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

You asked me to run this, and PANDA, PUMA, LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA, OTTER and GIRAFFE all fit it. Tell me which one to run; I will then find your input files and show a preview, and nothing runs until you approve it.

## S237521

Request: Using bulk expression and clinical follow-up for 400 lung adenocarcinoma patients, I need a model that predicts each new patient's overall-survival risk, something like a penalized Cox model that outputs a risk score, which I can then lock and apply to an external validation cohort of 150 patients from another hospital without refitting. Ideally the score would also show which genes drive the risk.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "I need a model that predicts each new patient's overall-survival risk, something like a penalized Cox model that outputs a risk score, which I can then lock and apply to an external validation cohort of 150 patients from another hospital without refitting." -- not available here as asked. NetZoo has no registered method or variant "penalized Cox model". No registered workflow fits a predictive or generative model; per-sample results can only be features for one built elsewhere.
2. "Ideally the score would also show which genes drive the risk." -- available from LIONESS-PANDA or LIONESS-PUMA.

About "a model that predicts each new patient's overall-survival risk": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

All of them derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks, and iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **LIONESS-PANDA**, **LIONESS-PUMA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.

Which regulator type should the network model: transcription factors, miRNA regulators, or both?

! Fallback recommendation — not an exact semantic match
✓ Guidance prepared
Fallback recommendation: **DRAGON**. This is registry-based guidance, not an exact semantic match. The system could not verify a complete goal-to-workflow match; this does not mean your question is unclear. No clarification is required to read this recommendation, and no executable plan has been selected.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** is related to that result and scale. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage.

Captured request parameters:

- `network_file`: an

**DRAGON**: Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON.

Routing-level input modality: multi omic continuous.

Method premise: infer conditional associations using partial correlation.

DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Other declared controls (not matched to this request; defaults apply unless you set them): `output_format`=matrix, `lambda1`, `lambda2`.

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Run SAMBAR on mut_pilot.csv (mutation counts for 5 cholangiocarcinomas) with exon_len.csv, cancer_genes.txt and hallmark.gmt, testing every subtype number from 2 through 8." -- not available here as asked. SAMBAR's subset_cancer_genes needs an explicit true or false value; "cancer_genes.txt" is unresolved. SAMBAR itself can still run, with its own settings instead -- an alternative, not the setting you asked for.

Fallback recommendation: **SAMBAR**. The request was interpreted and a candidate was found, but at least one quote supporting that reading could not be located in your text -- often a spelling or rephrasing difference, sometimes a detail the reading added. So this is shown as a candidate rather than a verified match, and nothing will run from it. Please check that the reading matches what you meant.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** is related to that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "I need a gene co-expression network for each of our 9 periodontitis gingival biopsies, with a p-value for every edge so I can filter them per sample." -- available from BONOBO.

Based on what you said — "I need a gene co-expression network for each of our 9 periodontitis gingival biopsies, with a p-value for every edge so I can filter them per sample." — **BONOBO** fits better: you asked for a p-value or confidence for each connection.

Your question asks for a per-sample co-expression network. **BONOBO** fits that result and scale.

**BONOBO** (recommend) — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable. Needs expression matrix. Produces inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result (one result per sample).

Conditional assumptions to confirm:
- It also needs an expression matrix; no file for it is named yet.
- The expression data is suitable for Bayesian analysis and does not require prior transformation validation.

Other compatible option(s):
- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — preferred when: dozens of samples or more; no sample covariates need to be separated or adjusted; approach: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks.

Should I use BONOBO, or does another listed option fit your study better?

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "estimate an activity score for every transcription factor in each of our 30 psoriasis skin samples" -- available from GIRAFFE.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "For each of our 40 kidney cancer patients I need one number per transcription factor that captures that TF's regulatory strength in that patient, so we can relate it to survival." -- available from LIONESS-PANDA's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: Sum edge weights per TF per sample from the edge-by-sample table; NetZoo does not compute it.

Selected path: **LIONESS-PANDA**.

**LIONESS-PANDA** — Infer aggregate PANDA and sample-specific LIONESS-PANDA networks. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Could you help me see how genes are connected in my sorghum heat-stress experiment?" -- available from LIONESS-COEXPRESSION or BONOBO.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **COBRA** — COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Needs expression matrix and sample covariate design matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Should the result be aggregate or sample-specific?

No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

## S313492

Request: Run the TF network inference on expr_alzheimer.tsv (88 donors: 44 AD, 44 controls), motifs_hg38.txt and ppi_tf.txt. The analysis plan just says 'a network for each AD and control', and I can't tell if that means one network per diagnostic group or one network per donor; the person who wrote it is on leave until next month.

  Input required

Input preflight failed, so the Work Plan is not ready:

- PANDA/PUMA inputs: error: expression file does not exist: [CHECKOUT]/expr_alzheimer.tsv
- PANDA/PUMA inputs: error: motif file does not exist: [CHECKOUT]/motifs_hg38.txt
- PANDA/PUMA inputs: error: PPI file does not exist: [CHECKOUT]/ppi_tf.txt

Please provide corrected files or fix the file contents, then I will re-check them.

Please provide corrected paths as field=path assignments (for example expression_file=data/expression.tsv). The files will be inspected again before execution.
Correction > 
Run the command again with --resume [SESSION] after preparing the answer.
