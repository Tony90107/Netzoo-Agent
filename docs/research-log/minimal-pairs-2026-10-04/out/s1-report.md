I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Your request describes more than one scientific reading. Each is listed with the registered workflows that fit it, their algorithmic premises and inputs:

**Reading 1 -- "RNA-seq"**
Result: regulatory networks (aggregate), from expression matrix.
- TF-only regulatory network:
  - **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
  - **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.
- TF-only signed regulatory-effect network:

Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

  - **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators.

Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

**Reading 2 -- regulatory networks**
Result: regulatory networks, from inputs the request does not state.
- TF-only regulatory network:
  - **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
  - **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.
- TF-only signed regulatory-effect network:

LIONESS-PANDA gives the per-sample result you asked for; it also writes the
cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.
  • Method: One TF-gene network per sample, derived leave-one-out from
    the cohort.
  • Needs: expression matrix, motif prior, PPI network.
  • Cost: N samples take N+1 PANDA runs (for your 24 patients, 25 PANDA

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 24 patients, 25 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

GIRAFFE fits your goal: cohort-level TF activity matrix.
  • Method: Also estimates per-sample TF activity and signed
    activating/repressing effects.
  • Needs: expression matrix, motif prior, PPI network.
  • Produces: regulatory network and TF activity matrix (one cohort-
    level result).
  • Nothing has run yet.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

- **COBRA** — COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Needs expression matrix and sample covariate design matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do you need to separate or adjust co-expression for batch, site or other sample covariates? (co-expression must be separated or adjusted for batch, site or other covariates → COBRA; no sample covariates need to be separated or adjusted → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION)

Here is how registered workflows can reach this result, with their algorithmic premises and inputs:

Result: sample cluster assignment (aggregate), from expression matrix.
No registered workflow assigns samples to clusters from expression. A registered workflow can give each sample a feature profile to cluster on:
- **LIONESS-PANDA** gives a TF-by-sample out-degree matrix -- each TF's summed edge weights to its targets in each sample's network (how strongly the TF is wired).
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks; iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
- **LIONESS-PUMA** gives the same out-degree matrix with miRNAs among the regulators (needs a miRNA list).
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks; iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list.
- **GIRAFFE** gives its TF-by-sample activity matrix -- how active each TF is apart from its own mRNA level, a different reading from wiring.
  - Method premise: factor gene expression using motif and TF-protein interaction priors; jointly infer a TF-gene regulatory matrix and a TF-by-sample activity matrix
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
- **BONOBO** gives one gene co-expression network per sample; with about genes-squared edges each, summarize them first (for example per-gene degree).
  - Method premise: Bayesian shrinkage estimation of sample-specific co-expression; sparsify sample-specific co-expression and return matching p-value matrices
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix.
- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** gives one gene co-expression network per sample, summarized the same way.
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix.
Clustering the samples on that matrix (for example hierarchical clustering or k-means) is not a NetZoo workflow; run it separately.
Per-sample networks from LIONESS are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.
Clusters are unsupervised: whether they predict an outcome such as treatment response has to be tested against that outcome, keyed by the same sample IDs.

Which per-sample profile should we start with: LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-PUMA, GIRAFFE, BONOBO or LIONESS-COEXPRESSION?
