What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each TF's activity per tumor" -- available from GIRAFFE.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The user has the necessary data for expression, motifs, and PPI for the analysis.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "The activity must not simply be the TF's own mRNA level." — GIRAFFE fits each TF's activity (`tf_activity_matrix`) from the expression of its target genes and the TF-TF protein interactions; the TF's own mRNA level is not an input to it. If the TF's gene is among the expression rows it still counts as an ordinary target, so its activity is not tied to its mRNA rather than independent of it.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "We want one TF-gene network." -- available from PANDA.

Yes, in principle, data can weaken an unreliable TF-binding prior and quantify uncertainty about it, but only if the model explicitly represents that uncertainty. A hierarchical Bayesian model can treat binding-site predictions as noisy evidence about latent TF-gene edges, with a source-reliability parameter and an expression-data likelihood. Conflicting evidence can lower posterior edge support; learning the source's reliability itself also requires an identifiable model and informative data, potentially including independent binding evidence or multiple priors. A Bayesian label alone does not supply this model.

No qualified registered workflow fully matches the requested modeling philosophy.

Outside this agent (reference only; it cannot run these):
- **TIGER** (netZooR, R) — Bayesian matrix factorization of expression with a prior TF-gene network and TF activities; sparse edge priors let the data shrink unsupported prior edges, one edge at a time. Chen & Padi 2024, doi:10.1038/s41540-024-00386-w.
- **Werhli & Husmeier (2007)** (published method, no NetZoo implementation) — Bayesian networks that give each prior-knowledge source its own weight, sampled by MCMC, so the data decide how much each prior counts. PMID 17542777.

A registered method with that philosophy estimates a different result:
- **BONOBO** — declared output: co-expression networks and matching p-value matrices (one per sample). BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

If you relax that requirement, these registered approaches can infer the requested network through different assumptions:

PANDA and OTTER tie only on the stated output and scope. This does not show that they are equally robust to a noisy motif prior; neither estimates its reliability as a posterior probability.

1. **PANDA** — Iterative message passing reconciles the motif seed with TF-TF interactions and gene co-expression, repeatedly revising TF-gene edge support across those networks. The edge weights summarize integrated evidence, not a posterior probability that the motif prior is reliable.

2. **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

For the probabilistic reliability estimate you asked for, the hierarchical model above remains the recommendation. If stable network scores would suffice instead, perturb or replace the motif prior and compare inferred edges against independent evidence. Neither algorithm is known from the stated facts to be more robust for your study.

Selected path: **PUMA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

Your question asks for a per-sample co-expression network. **BONOBO** fits that result and scale. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression.

**BONOBO**: Infer sample-specific gene-gene co-expression networks with netZooPy BONOBO.

Routing-level input modality: expression matrix.

Method premise: Bayesian shrinkage estimation of sample-specific co-expression; sparsify sample-specific co-expression and return matching p-value matrices.

BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

Required workflow inputs:

Controls matching this request:

When `sparsify=False` and `save_pvals=False`: full sample-specific gene-gene co-expression matrices; no p-value artifact is written.

When `sparsify=True` and `save_pvals=False`: upstream thresholds each sample-specific co-expression matrix; no p-value artifact is written.

When `sparsify=True` and `save_pvals=True`: upstream retains the full co-expression matrix for each selected sample and writes a matching p-value matrix; threshold it from the saved p-value matrix; it does not also emit an already-thresholded network in this mode.

1. "We want subtypes from pathway mutation scores." -- available from SAMBAR.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

For “co-expression network per sample” and “cohort-wide network”:

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

For “co-expression network per sample”:

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "We want subtypes from pathway mutation scores." -- available from SAMBAR.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level pathway mutation matrix. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Request (turn 1): We have expression, motifs and PPI for 75 samples. We want one TF-gene network. The motif prior we provide must be part of the estimate.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "We want one TF-gene network." -- available from PANDA.

Yes, in principle, data can weaken an unreliable TF-binding prior and quantify uncertainty about it, but only if the model explicitly represents that uncertainty. A hierarchical Bayesian model can treat binding-site predictions as noisy evidence about latent TF-gene edges, with a source-reliability parameter and an expression-data likelihood. Conflicting evidence can lower posterior edge support; learning the source's reliability itself also requires an identifiable model and informative data, potentially including independent binding evidence or multiple priors. A Bayesian label alone does not supply this model.

No qualified registered workflow fully matches the requested modeling philosophy.

Outside this agent (reference only; it cannot run these):
- **TIGER** (netZooR, R) — Bayesian matrix factorization of expression with a prior TF-gene network and TF activities; sparse edge priors let the data shrink unsupported prior edges, one edge at a time. Chen & Padi 2024, doi:10.1038/s41540-024-00386-w.
- **Werhli & Husmeier (2007)** (published method, no NetZoo implementation) — Bayesian networks that give each prior-knowledge source its own weight, sampled by MCMC, so the data decide how much each prior counts. PMID 17542777.

A registered method with that philosophy estimates a different result:
- **BONOBO** — declared output: co-expression networks and matching p-value matrices (one per sample). BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

If you relax that requirement, these registered approaches can infer the requested network through different assumptions:

PANDA and OTTER tie only on the stated output and scope. This does not show that they are equally robust to a noisy motif prior; neither estimates its reliability as a posterior probability.

1. **PANDA** — Iterative message passing reconciles the motif seed with TF-TF interactions and gene co-expression, repeatedly revising TF-gene edge support across those networks. The edge weights summarize integrated evidence, not a posterior probability that the motif prior is reliable.

2. **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

For the probabilistic reliability estimate you asked for, the hierarchical model above remains the recommendation. If stable network scores would suffice instead, perturb or replace the motif prior and compare inferred edges against independent evidence. Neither algorithm is known from the stated facts to be more robust for your study.

Request (turn 1): We want a partial-correlation network between expression and metabolites in 90 matched samples.
Request (turn 2): Every edge should be conditioned on all other features of both layers.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "partial-correlation network between expression and metabolites" -- available from DRAGON.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a separate TF-gene network for each sample" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 100 samples, 101 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.
