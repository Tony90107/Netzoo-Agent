What I understood you are asking for:
1. "the communities of our bipartite TF-gene network" -- available from CONDOR.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "Is there a method that builds one network including both TF and miRNA regulators?" -- available from PUMA or LIONESS-PUMA.

Selected path: **PUMA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network. **PUMA** fits that result and scale.

**PUMA** — Infer an aggregate TF/miRNA-to-gene regulatory network with PUMA. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network
- `mirna_file`: miRNA list

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a two-layer network between proteins and transcripts in 85 matched samples" -- available from DRAGON.
2. "the causal direction of each link" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. Every registered workflow estimates associations or model coefficients from observational data.

About "the causal direction of each link": None of the registered workflows can show that one thing causes another: they estimate associations or model coefficients from the expression data, so the networks can describe what differs or changes but not show why. A before-and-after comparison without an untreated comparison group also cannot separate the treatment's effect from time or other changes.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each tumor's own copy-number-expression partial-correlation network" -- available from LIONESS-DRAGON.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- No scale was stated; DRAGON gives one result for the whole cohort; LIONESS-DRAGON gives one result per sample.

Selected path: **LIONESS-DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a multi-omic network. **LIONESS-DRAGON** fits that result.

**LIONESS-DRAGON** — Infer one sample-specific two-layer multi-omic partial-correlation network per sample with LIONESS-DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Cost: LIONESS runs DRAGON once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 DRAGON runs and give N network files. Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- LIONESS-DRAGON estimates DRAGON's two shrinkage values once on all samples, then derives each sample's network from the all-sample network and the network refitted without that sample.
- Each sample's network is an undirected partial-correlation graph across both layers; like DRAGON's, it is an association graph, not a causal one.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

What you asked about:

- "We want mutation-based subtypes and their association with overall survival." — Subtype labels can be compared with clinical variables -- survival between subtypes, for example; that needs a clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs. The pathway mutation scores show which pathways separate the subtypes.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "TF activity scores per sample that do not just mirror TF mRNA levels" -- available from GIRAFFE.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "do not just mirror TF mRNA levels" — GIRAFFE fits each TF's activity (`tf_activity_matrix`) from the expression of its target genes and the TF-TF protein interactions; the TF's own mRNA level is not an input to it. If the TF's gene is among the expression rows it still counts as an ordinary target, so its activity is not tied to its mRNA rather than independent of it.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

- "TF activity per sample compared between tumor and normal." — The activity matrix holds one value per TF per sample (TF by sample, written as the `.tfa` output). GIRAFFE reports absolute activity, so every value is zero or positive.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

For your question ("we want TF activity per sample compared between tumor and normal"):
- **GIRAFFE** — The activity matrix compares TF activity, not network wiring, between the conditions; test each TF's activity between them (paired when the same individuals give both).

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "the co-expression split into the parts associated with sex and with age" -- available from COBRA.

Selected path: **COBRA**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level co-expression network. **COBRA** fits that result and scale.

**COBRA** — Model covariate-associated gene co-expression with COBRA. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each TF's activity per sample" -- available from GIRAFFE.
2. "a model that predicts drug response from those activities" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. No registered workflow fits a predictive or generative model; per-sample results can only be features for one built elsewhere.

About "a model that predicts drug response from those activities": No registered workflow builds a model that predicts an outcome for new samples. Per-sample results -- targeting scores from per-sample networks, GIRAFFE's TF activities, or subtypes -- can serve as features for a classifier you build outside NetZoo, which then needs the outcome for each sample and testing on samples not used to build it.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a co-expression network per sample" -- available from LIONESS-COEXPRESSION or BONOBO.

Several registered methods fit this result; they differ in their modeling assumptions:

- **LIONESS-COEXPRESSION** — LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. Needs expression matrix.
- **BONOBO** — BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. Needs expression matrix.

Both fit; to choose, tell me: (1) About how many samples do you have? (only a handful of samples → BONOBO; dozens of samples or more → LIONESS-COEXPRESSION) (2) Do you need a confidence value for each connection in each sample? (yes → BONOBO)

You mentioned "80 samples". Whether that counts as a handful of samples or as dozens or more is your call for this study design; I do not map a sample count to these categories myself.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "subtypes from pathway mutation scores" -- available from SAMBAR.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Gene length normalization addresses the greater opportunity for mutations in longer genes; gene/exon sizes are therefore required, not just the mutation matrix.

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a network linking expression and methylation" -- available from DRAGON.
2. "Each link also needs a multiple-testing adjusted p-value." -- available from DRAGON.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

R1: "a low-dimensional embedding vector for every gene"

Reply:

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a low-dimensional embedding vector for every gene" -- available from CONDOR.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.
