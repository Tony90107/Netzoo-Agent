What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a separate TF-gene network for each sample" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 110 samples, 111 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "groups the patients into subtypes from pathway-level mutation scores" -- available from SAMBAR.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "We want a regulatory network." -- available from PANDA or OTTER.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "compare regulatory networks between our responders and non-responders" -- available from PANDA's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: One run per condition on the same genes and priors, then compare; two aggregate networks give no per-sample spread for a test.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **PANDA**, **OTTER** — Targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree or a gene's indegree summarizes the network per regulator or per gene; comparing them between networks built separately for each condition shows regulators whose targeting changes. Comparing conditions needs one run per condition on matched inputs (the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors); edge weights are comparable only within that shared setup.
- **PANDA** — For per-sample scores to test against clinical variables, use LIONESS-PANDA instead.
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.
- **OTTER** — OTTER weights are on a different scale from PANDA's; compare OTTER networks only with other OTTER networks built with the same parameters.
- **GIRAFFE** — The TF-by-sample activity matrix (TFA) can serve as predictors in association tests with sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. Relating per-sample results to sample-level variables needs an annotation or clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs, supplied separately. Signs in the regulatory matrix are partial linear effects (positive for activation, negative for repression); read them as model coefficients, not as proof of direct binding.

For your question ("compare regulatory networks between our responders and non-responders"):
- **PANDA** — Build one network per group on the same genes and priors, then compare edge weights or each regulator's targeting score (out-degree) between the group networks. Two aggregate networks give one value per edge per group: they show where the groups differ, but give no per-sample spread to test it. For a statistical test, use the per-sample (LIONESS) version and test between the groups.
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Each sample gets its own network, so each edge weight or targeting score can be tested between the groups across samples -- for example with a linear model such as limma.
- **OTTER** — Build one network per group on the same genes and priors, then compare edge weights or each regulator's targeting score (out-degree) between the group networks. Two aggregate networks give one value per edge per group: they show where the groups differ, but give no per-sample spread to test it. For a statistical test, use a per-sample method such as LIONESS-PANDA and test between the groups.
- **GIRAFFE** — The activity matrix compares TF activity, not network wiring, between the conditions; test each TF's activity between them (paired when the same individuals give both).
Note: All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in any test across samples.
Note: OTTER weights are on a different scale from PANDA's; compare OTTER networks only with other OTTER networks built with the same parameters.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "We want its gene modules, found with bipartite modularity." -- available from CONDOR.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Request (turn 1): From expression, motifs and PPI of 110 lymphoma samples, which method gives a separate TF-gene network for each sample?

R1: "a separate TF-gene network for each sample"

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "which method gives a separate TF-gene network for each sample?" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 110 samples, 111 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

Reply:

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "which method gives a separate TF-gene network for each cell?" -- the backup check matched no registered workflow to this (not confirmed).
The usual capability check could not run this turn, so a backup model read the request; the lines above are not confirmed, and the methods below were not removed for them.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA.

Reply:

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "each TF's activity in each tumor, beyond what its own mRNA level shows" -- available from GIRAFFE.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level TF activity matrix. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

What you asked about:

- "beyond what its own mRNA level shows" — GIRAFFE fits each TF's activity (`tf_activity_matrix`) from the expression of its target genes and the TF-TF protein interactions; the TF's own mRNA level is not an input to it. If the TF's gene is among the expression rows it still counts as an ordinary target, so its activity is not tied to its mRNA rather than independent of it.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a network of direct partial-correlation links within and between the two layers, with a p-value for each edge" -- available from DRAGON.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

Input compatibility has not been assessed: your data was not checked against the workflow's required inputs; name your input files to have them checked. This is workflow guidance only; no execution was authorized. No files were inspected and no analysis ran.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level gene mutation scores. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.
- `sample_distance_matrix`: Pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 110 samples, 111 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.

**CONDOR** — Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Selected path: **DRAGON**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level multi-omic network. **DRAGON** fits that result and scale.

**DRAGON** — Infer an aggregate two-layer multi-omic Gaussian graphical model with DRAGON. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

Required workflow inputs:

- `omics_layer_1`: DRAGON omics layer 1
- `omics_layer_2`: DRAGON omics layer 2

Outputs:

- `multi_omic_network`: Inferred associations between omics features.

Workflow-specific scientific notes:

- DRAGON uses two layer-specific shrinkage parameters, lambda1 and lambda2, rather than a generic Graphical Lasso penalty matrix.
- DRAGON's precision-derived partial correlations estimate within-layer and cross-layer conditional associations after accounting for the other modeled features; this is an undirected association graph, not a causal guarantee or proof that every indirect effect is removed.
- The declared DRAGON API does not expose a separately tunable third cross-layer penalty such as lambda_inter; three independently controlled intra/inter-omics penalties are outside this workflow contract.

No registered workflow produces this as you asked it, so none is offered for it as asked. The note below describes the closest route.

**Building the prior from chromatin accessibility.** Keeping only motif sites in open chromatin is a step before network inference, and no registered workflow performs it. SPIDER (Sonawane et al. 2021; netZooR and netZooM, not registered here) does this and then runs PANDA's message passing. A manual route: scan TF motifs (for example FIMO or HOMER), keep the sites inside your ATAC-seq peaks (for example bedtools intersect), assign the kept sites to genes with a stated promoter window (for example TSS -750/+250 bp or +/-1 kb), and write the TF-gene pairs as a binary motif prior. Then run PANDA or OTTER (registered) with that prior and the expression matrix from the same tissues. A promoter window misses distal enhancers unless enhancer-gene links are added.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "We want to compare regulatory networks between our responders and non-responders" -- available from PANDA's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: One run per condition on the same genes and priors, then compare; two aggregate networks give no per-sample spread for a test.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

About your concern that what to do with the result afterwards, for example comparing conditions or relating it to clinical variables:
- **PANDA**, **PUMA**, **OTTER** — Targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree or a gene's indegree summarizes the network per regulator or per gene; comparing them between networks built separately for each condition shows regulators whose targeting changes. Comparing conditions needs one run per condition on matched inputs (the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors); edge weights are comparable only within that shared setup.
- **PANDA** — For per-sample scores to test against clinical variables, use LIONESS-PANDA instead.
- **PUMA** — For per-sample scores to test against clinical variables, use LIONESS-PUMA instead.
- **LIONESS-PANDA**, **LIONESS-PUMA** — Per-sample targeting scores: a regulator's outdegree (the sum of its edge weights to its targets) or a gene's indegree, computed in each sample's network, gives a regulator-by-sample (or gene-by-sample) matrix you can relate to sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. An ordered variable such as disease stage can be tested for a trend, for example with ordinal or linear regression on stage; testing every regulator or edge needs multiple-testing correction (for example Benjamini-Hochberg). Stages seen in different patients are cross-sectional, so a trend across them is not one patient's progression. That association needs a clinical table (for survival: follow-up time and event status) keyed by the same sample IDs as the expression matrix; it is not a workflow input, so supply it separately. All LIONESS networks are derived from the same cohort, so they are not statistically independent; account for this in the association test, which is a later analysis step rather than part of this workflow.
- **OTTER** — OTTER weights are on a different scale from PANDA's; compare OTTER networks only with other OTTER networks built with the same parameters.
- **GIRAFFE** — The TF-by-sample activity matrix (TFA) can serve as predictors in association tests with sample-level variables -- survival, for example, with a Cox model. Relating per-sample results to sample-level variables needs an annotation or clinical table keyed by the same sample IDs, supplied separately. Signs in the regulatory matrix are partial linear effects (positive for activation, negative for repression); read them as model coefficients, not as proof of direct binding.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression.

Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

- PUMA uses message passing to integrate miRNA-target predictions with target-gene co-expression alongside TF motif and PPI evidence.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

**What your data allows.** Your request names only a motif prior and a PPI network. PUMA also needs a miRNA list. With a motif prior and a PPI network alone, PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, LIONESS-COEXPRESSION, OTTER or GIRAFFE builds one cohort-level network instead. Do you also have a miRNA list?

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PUMA also writes the cohort network, so PUMA need not run first.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Outputs:

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

Ask for the workflow's controls and defaults if you want to set them.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "a network for each patient" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.
2. "a test of which TFs' targeting relates to survival" -- available from LIONESS-PANDA's output plus a step you run outside NetZoo: A statistical model outside NetZoo (e.g. limma, Cox), with multiple-testing correction; needs a clinical table keyed by sample ID.

It sounds like you want sample-specific TF/gene regulatory networks.

Registered method and input/output fit:
- **TF-only regulatory network — PANDA → LIONESS-PANDA**
  - Registered purpose: Infer aggregate PANDA and sample-specific LIONESS-PANDA networks.
  - Method premise: derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks; iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks; the participating layers depend on the registered workflow
  - Mathematical interpretation: LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.
  - Mathematical interpretation: Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
  - Declared output: regulatory networks (cohort-level aggregate; sample-specific, one network per sample).

The only registered workflow compatible with this request is **LIONESS-PANDA**, but it infers a regulatory network from its inputs, while your request reads as asking to analyze an existing result; and your request does not settle the kind of result. Is LIONESS-PANDA the analysis you want? If so, say so and name its inputs; otherwise describe the result you need.

There are different analyses to consider here. The useful distinction is what each method assumes and what you want to learn from the data.

**BONOBO**. BONOBO applies Bayesian estimation and shrinkage to sample-specific gene-gene co-expression. It does not model uncertain TF-binding/motif priors or return TF-to-gene regulatory edges. A shared probabilistic philosophy does not make these scientific outputs interchangeable.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations; p-value matrix paired with a sample-specific gene-gene co-expression result.

**COBRA**. COBRA models co-expression as a function of sample covariates through conditional covariance estimation. Correcting gene means alone may leave covariance confounding. Covariate-associated components are not TF-to-gene regulatory edges or proof that a covariate causes the expression pattern.

You would need expression matrix, sample covariate design matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

**CONDOR**. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

You would need bipartite network. The analysis would provide network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

**DRAGON**. DRAGON fits a two-layer Gaussian graphical model with layer-aware shrinkage. Partial correlations describe associations conditional on the other measured features under that model; they are not directed causal effects. The two omics layers must refer to matched samples.

You would need DRAGON omics layer 1, DRAGON omics layer 2. The analysis would provide inferred associations between omics features.

**GIRAFFE**. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations; inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

**LIONESS-COEXPRESSION**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.

You would need expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred gene-to-gene associations.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PANDA also writes the cohort network, so PANDA need not run first.

**LIONESS-PUMA**. LIONESS represents the cohort network through sample contributions: W_q = N*W_all - (N-1)*W_without_q, where N is the cohort size and the same base estimator is fitted with and without sample q. The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations. LIONESS-PUMA also writes the cohort network, so PUMA need not run first.

**OTTER**. OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Its lambda balances those two fit terms and gamma regularizes W; a PPI-transformed motif matrix initializes W rather than contributing a motif-fidelity term to that loss. Neither parameter estimates motif-prior reliability, and optimized edge scores are not posterior probabilities.

You would need motif/prior, PPI network, either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PANDA**. Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**PUMA**. PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators.

Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.

You would need expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network, miRNA list. The analysis would provide inferred regulator-to-target associations.

**SAMBAR**. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

You would need somatic mutation matrix, gene/exon-size CSV, cancer-gene list, GMT pathway file. The analysis would provide sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores; pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels; sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices; pairwise sample distances, not cluster labels.

Reply:

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "discover de novo motifs enriched in the peaks" -- not available here: no registered workflow produces this. PANDA does not give it: the motif prior is an input; PANDA never searches sequence.

No registered workflow produces this as you asked it, so none is offered for it as asked. The note below describes the closest route.

**Building the prior from chromatin accessibility.** Keeping only motif sites in open chromatin is a step before network inference, and no registered workflow performs it. SPIDER (Sonawane et al. 2021; netZooR and netZooM, not registered here) does this and then runs PANDA's message passing. A manual route: scan TF motifs (for example FIMO or HOMER), keep the sites inside your ATAC-seq peaks (for example bedtools intersect), assign the kept sites to genes with a stated promoter window (for example TSS -750/+250 bp or +/-1 kb), and write the TF-gene pairs as a binary motif prior. Then run PANDA or OTTER (registered) with that prior and the expression matrix from the same tissues. A promoter window misses distal enhancers unless enhancer-gene links are added.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "We want a TF-gene network for each sample." -- available from LIONESS-PANDA.

For the sample-specific output you described, use **LIONESS-PANDA**.

Required inputs:
   - `expression_file`: Expression matrix
   - `motif_file`: Motif/prior
   - `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:
   - Aggregate network (`output_file`).
   - Sample-specific network for each patient/sample (`lioness_output`).

You do not need to run **PANDA** separately; **LIONESS-PANDA** also produces the aggregate output. Use **PANDA** alone only when a cohort-level aggregate result is sufficient.

Cost: LIONESS runs PANDA once on all samples and once more without each sample, so N samples take N+1 PANDA runs and give N network files (for your 70 samples, 71 PANDA runs). Plan the runtime and disk space, and filter edges before downstream statistics.

Out-degree measures how strongly a TF is wired to its targets in each sample. If you mean TF activity instead -- how active a TF is apart from its own mRNA level -- GIRAFFE's TF-by-sample activity matrix is the other reading, from the expression, motif and PPI inputs.

**What your data allows.** LIONESS-PANDA and PANDA need a motif prior and a PPI network, which you said you do not have ("We have expression from 70 colon samples.").

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale.
