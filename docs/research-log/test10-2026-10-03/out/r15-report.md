What I understood you are asking for:
1. "estimate how strongly each transcription factor regulates its target genes across these tissues, while also accounting for TFs that cooperate in complexes." -- available from PANDA.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) (2) Do you suspect a regulator's activity differs across samples even when its own expression does not, or do you need activating versus repressing effects? (yes → GIRAFFE) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

All of them derive each sample network from all-sample and leave-one-out networks, and iteratively exchange information across biological evidence networks.

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PANDA** — Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **LIONESS-PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

Unconfirmed assumptions in these interpretations (please correct me if needed):
- The expression profiles are suitable for regulatory network inference.

Which regulator type should the network model: transcription factors, miRNA regulators, or both?

**What your data allows.** Your request names only expression data. LIONESS-PANDA also needs a motif prior and a PPI network; LIONESS-PUMA also needs a motif prior, a PPI network and a miRNA list. With expression data alone, LIONESS-COEXPRESSION or BONOBO builds one gene-gene co-expression network per sample (genes only, no regulator roles) instead. Do you also have a motif prior and a PPI network?

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "partition this network into tightly connected regulatory modules to see which groups of TFs jointly control which sets of target genes" -- available from CONDOR.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- The user has already computed the regulatory edge weights and is looking for a method to analyze the structure of the network.

Selected path: **CONDOR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level community assignment. **CONDOR** fits that result and scale. CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model.

**CONDOR**: Detect communities in a validated bipartite network with CONDOR.

Routing-level input modality: regulatory network.

Method premise: find communities in a two-mode network; return network modules or community membership.

CONDOR uses bipartite modularity and BRIM: regulator and target nodes remain separate partitions, and between-partition connectivity is compared with a degree/strength-preserving bipartite null model. A giant community can reflect an unsuitable null model, resolution or weight handling. Hubs alone do not prove every conventional algorithm fails, and bipartite modularity does not guarantee biologically meaningful modules. Verify the edge-weight conventions.

Required workflow inputs:

- `network_file`: bipartite network

Before CONDOR: a PANDA or LIONESS network is dense and its edge weights can be negative. netZooR's pandaToCondorObject keeps only edges above a threshold (by default midway between the median weights of prior and non-prior edges) before CONDOR; threshold your network the same way, or otherwise make the weights non-negative, before running it here. CONDOR puts each node in one community and gives each node a core score, its share of its community's modularity, which picks out each module's core regulators.

Other declared controls (not matched to this request; defaults apply unless you set them): `prefix`=condor.

Distinct declared output artifacts (availability depends on workflow options):

- `community_assignment`: Network-node community memberships, not patient subtype labels.

No registered workflow produces these as you asked them, so none is offered for them as asked. The note below describes the closest route.

**Single-cell data.** The registered workflows are built for bulk samples. Co-expression between individual cells is dominated by dropout, so per-cell LIONESS or BONOBO networks are not advised. A registered route: sum cells into pseudo-bulk profiles per donor and cell state, then run PANDA (or OTTER) once per state with the same genes and the same motif and PPI priors; this needs several donors per state to estimate co-expression. To look within a state, SCORPION (an R package from the Kuijjer lab, not registered here) first aggregates similar cells into metacells and then runs PANDA on them, giving comparable networks per sample or state.

What I understood you are asking for:
1. "summarize these scattered gene-level mutations into pathway-level scores for each patient using known pathway annotations" -- available from SAMBAR.
2. "subtype patients on those scores" -- available from SAMBAR.

Assumptions behind this recommendation (not confirmed facts):

- Pathway annotations are available and can be used to aggregate gene mutations into pathway scores.
- The pathway-level scores will provide a more meaningful representation for patient subtyping than the original gene-level data.

Selected path: **SAMBAR**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level sample cluster assignment. **SAMBAR** fits that result and scale.

Why this recommendation:

Gene-length normalization scales each gene's non-silent mutation count by its exon length. Patient-burden normalization then rescales those gene scores by the patient-specific cancer-associated mutation rate, reducing domination by globally hypermutated samples. Pathway aggregation next corrects for pathway size and for genes annotated to multiple pathways, compressing sparse, heterogeneous gene events into comparable pathway-by-sample scores. Patients with mutations in different genes within the same biological pathway can therefore share a functional signal that gene-by-gene comparison would miss. These corrections require gene/exon lengths, a cancer-gene set, and pathway annotations in addition to the mutation matrix. This compression does not guarantee meaningful clusters; residual mutation burden, gene-set coverage, batch effects, and cluster stability still require validation.

Pathway aggregation turns gene mutation scores into pathway-by-sample scores; sample distances are then calculated from those profiles, and clustering assigns sample labels. These are separate artifacts, not patient-specific mutation networks.

**SAMBAR** — Subtype somatic-mutation samples through pathway mutation scores with SAMBAR. SAMBAR reduces sparse mutation data to pathway-level scores with gene-length and, when configured, patient mutation-burden normalization. Patient distances and subtype labels depend on the downstream clustering settings; they are distinct from gene communities in a regulatory network. This is pathway aggregation followed by distance-based clustering, not non-negative matrix factorization; a mutation score does not establish permanent functional loss or equivalence of every mutation in a pathway.

Required workflow inputs:

- `mutation_file`: somatic mutation matrix
- `exon_size_file`: gene/exon-size CSV
- `cancer_gene_file`: cancer-gene list
- `pathway_file`: GMT pathway file

Outputs:

- `gene_mutation_scores`: Sample-by-gene mutation scores, not pathway scores.
- `pathway_mutation_matrix`: Pathway-by-sample mutation scores, not cluster labels.
- `sample_cluster_assignment`: Sample-to-cluster labels, separate from score and distance matrices.

Selected path: **GIRAFFE**.

Your question asks for a cohort-level regulatory network with TF activities. **GIRAFFE** fits that result and scale.

**GIRAFFE** — Use biologically informed matrix factorization with netZooPy GIRAFFE to jointly infer R and TFA by fitting Y approximately R times absolute TFA; TFA provides the sample-varying predictors and R contains signed partial regulatory effects interpretable as linear-model coefficients, positive for activation and negative for repression. GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality.

Required workflow inputs:

- `expression_file`: expression matrix
- `motif_file`: motif/prior
- `ppi_file`: PPI network

Outputs:

- `regulatory_network`: Inferred regulator-to-target associations.
- `tf_activity_matrix`: Inferred transcription-factor-by-sample activity values.

TF activity is how active a TF is in each sample, apart from its own mRNA level. If you mean how strongly each TF is wired to its targets in each sample, the out-degree in LIONESS-PANDA's per-sample networks is the other reading, from the same inputs.

**Building the prior from chromatin accessibility.** Keeping only motif sites in open chromatin is a step before network inference, and no registered workflow performs it. SPIDER (Sonawane et al. 2021; netZooR and netZooM, not registered here) does this and then runs PANDA's message passing. A manual route: scan TF motifs (for example FIMO or HOMER), keep the sites inside your ATAC-seq peaks (for example bedtools intersect), assign the kept sites to genes with a stated promoter window (for example TSS -750/+250 bp or +/-1 kb), and write the TF-gene pairs as a binary motif prior. Then run PANDA or OTTER (registered) with that prior and the expression matrix from the same tissues. A promoter window misses distal enhancers unless enhancer-gene links are added.

**Comparing module structure between two networks.** CONDOR partitions one network at a time. Running it on each network gives two unaligned sets of communities, so a split or a merge can only be judged by matching them afterwards, for example by gene overlap. ALPACA (Padi & Quackenbush 2018; netZooR `pandaToAlpaca`, not registered here) compares the two directly: it uses the control network as the null model for the disease network's modularity (differential modularity) and returns each node's module and its contribution score.

This turn could not be checked against what the registered workflows produce, so the methods below have not been confirmed to give what you asked for.

I can map this to more than one compatible network result:

**TF-only regulatory network**
- **PANDA** — Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PANDA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.
- **OTTER** — OTTER optimizes a TF-gene matrix W so that W W-transpose matches the TF-TF interaction network and W-transpose W matches gene co-expression. Needs motif/prior, PPI network and either expression matrix or adjusted co-expression matrix.

**TF-only signed regulatory-effect network**
- **GIRAFFE** — GIRAFFE jointly factors expression into a regulatory-effect matrix and sample-varying TF activities using biological priors. Signed effects describe the fitted activation/repression relationship, while activity differs from the TF's own expression. These fitted coefficients do not alone establish causality. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior and PPI network.

**TF/miRNA regulatory network**
- **PUMA** — PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression. Per-sample version: **LIONESS-PUMA**. Needs expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network and miRNA list.

**On a convex, globally optimal guarantee.** None of the registered methods offers one. OTTER is posed as a non-convex optimization (Weighill et al. 2021): the network W is fitted so that W times its transpose matches the PPI and its transpose times W matches co-expression. The paper derives a spectral solution with recovery guarantees under its assumptions, but the netZooPy OTTER registered here takes a fixed number of gradient steps from a motif-based start, which reaches a local solution. PANDA's iterative updates do not minimize a stated objective. OTTER does give the explicit objective you asked for.

These all fit; to choose, tell me: (1) Do the regulators include miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that repress or degrade their target transcripts after transcription? (yes → PUMA, LIONESS-PUMA) (2) Is the network large enough that memory or runtime is a concern? (yes → OTTER) If none of these applies: PANDA, LIONESS-PANDA, GIRAFFE.

The leave-one-out network alone is not the patient's network. This borrows cohort information; it does not estimate a correlation from one isolated observation or prove causality. With PANDA, edge weights are inferred regulatory support, not measured binding strength. Cross-sectional networks do not establish temporal rewiring.
  - Mathematical interpretation: Message passing iteratively reconciles a regulator-target prior with other biological evidence networks. Other evidence can revise the initial edge support, but the resulting weights are integrated network scores, not calibrated posterior probabilities of prior reliability.
  - Required inputs: all of: expression matrix, motif/prior, PPI network.
  - Declared output: regulatory networks (cohort-level aggregate; sample-specific, one network per sample).

  - Mathematical interpretation: PUMA extends PANDA's message passing to miRNA regulators. Their prior edges usually come from sequence-based target prediction such as TargetScan or miRanda, and can sit in the same prior as TF motif edges. Because miRNAs do not form the protein complexes that the cooperativity network represents, PUMA keeps each miRNA's cooperativity with other regulators at its initial value instead of updating it. Evidence for a miRNA-gene edge therefore comes from agreement between the predicted targets and target-gene co-expression; the miRNA's own expression is not used, and anti-correlation receives no special weight for repression.

**Reading 2 -- "model associations with disease stage and survival."**
Result: signed regulatory-effect networks (sample-specific), from inputs the request does not state.
No registered workflow produces sample-specific signed regulatory-effect networks; GIRAFFE produces them for the whole cohort.

Which reading should we start with: 1 (LIONESS-PANDA or LIONESS-PUMA), 2 (no registered workflow)? If a reading should use different data, say which.
